FREE INDUSTRY-STANDARD NER LIBRARIES - COMPARISON AND RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

YES - There are several free, industry-standard libraries that do NER reliably
and securely. Here are the best options:

================================================================================
1. SPACY (RECOMMENDED FOR THIS PROJECT)
================================================================================

LICENSE: MIT (Free, open source)
STATUS: Industry standard, widely used
SECURITY: ✅ All processing is LOCAL (no data sent to servers)

FEATURES:
- Pre-trained models for English (and 20+ languages)
- Identifies: PERSON, ORG, GPE (locations), DATE, MONEY, etc.
- Fast and efficient (written in Cython)
- Easy to use Python API
- Can be fine-tuned on custom data
- Active community and regular updates

INSTALLATION:
pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm  # Small model (~12 MB)
python -m spacy download en_core_web_md    # Medium model (~40 MB)
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg   # Large model (~560 MB)

USAGE EXAMPLE:
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp("Anna Sattler works at Alaska Village Electric Coop in Bethel, Alaska.")
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_)
# Output:
# Anna Sattler PERSON
# Alaska Village Electric Coop ORG
# Bethel GPE
# Alaska GPE

ACCURACY:
- Small model: ~85% F1 score on standard NER benchmarks
- Large model: ~90% F1 score
- Good balance of speed and accuracy

PRIVACY/SECURITY:
✅ All processing happens locally on your machine
✅ No data sent to external servers
✅ No internet connection required after model download

RECOMMENDATION FOR YOUR PROJECT
================================================================================

BEST CHOICE: spaCy

REASONS:
1. ✅ FREE and open source (MIT license)
2. ✅ Industry standard (used by thousands of companies)
3. ✅ Reliable (85-90% accuracy)
4. ✅ SECURE (all processing local, no data leaves your machine)
5. ✅ Easy to use (simple Python API)
6. ✅ Fast (efficient Cython implementation)
7. ✅ Good documentation
8. ✅ Active community
9. ✅ Perfect for privacy-sensitive transcripts
10. ✅ Can work completely offline

INSTALLATION STEPS:
1. pip install spacy
2. python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
3. Use in your code (see example above)

INTEGRATION WITH YOUR CODE:
You could add spaCy as an additional extraction method:

```python
import spacy

class DeIdentifier:
    def __init__(self):
        # ... existing code ...
        try:
            self.nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
            self.use_spacy = True
        except:
            self.use_spacy = False
    
    def extract_entities_with_spacy(self, text: str):
        """Extract entities using spaCy NER."""
        if not self.use_spacy:
            return {}
        
        doc = self.nlp(text)
        entities = {
            "persons": [],
            "organizations": [],
            "locations": [],
            "tribes": []
        }
        
        for ent in doc.ents:
            if ent.label_ == "PERSON":
                entities["persons"].append(ent.text)
            elif ent.label_ in ["ORG", "ORGANIZATION"]:
                entities["organizations"].append(ent.text)
            elif ent.label_ in ["GPE", "LOC", "LOCATION"]:
                entities["locations"].append(ent.text)
        
        return entities
```

BENEFITS FOR YOUR USE CASE:
- Finds names in dialogue (not just speaker labels)
- Identifies locations automatically (no hardcoded lists)
- More comprehensive extraction
- Still maintains privacy (all local)
- Can combine with your existing validation

================================================================================
