[C.12] Interviewer: what Pamela, updated us on, that, that's really, groundbreaking for cooperative development.
[C.13] Interviewer: education, and I want to put a plug in, Person_5. I would love to see that at our Organization_50, also, if you could, you know, extend that offer.

[A.18] Interviewer: I wanted to say, I wanted to ask, first of Location_7, where is your cooperative located? I don't know if you're Location_7 part of the same cooperative, or…
[A.19] Interviewer: part of different Organization_7? If you would say, like, where your, cooperative is located.
[B.16] Interviewee: Currently, Organization_14 and Three Sisters Garden JAG program aren't involved in a cooperative of sorts. I think we're kind of really wanting to dive into that and be involved in that, just to make those connections and, get our produce out to
[B.17] Interviewee: community area people.
[C.16] Interviewer: Yeah.
[B.18] Interviewee: There is a… there is a recent development with an organization called Black Chick Farms. Person_7, out of Location_17, Location_1, she has a USDA grant
[B.19] Interviewee: And she found out about our farm, and found out the students were growing Location_7 this food, and she asked me,
[B.20] Interviewee: if we were doing donations to, like, our senior center, our youth shelter, our WIC program, and I confirmed that, yes, we do that on a regular basis.
[B.21] Interviewee: weekly to every two weeks, and she asked me if I,
[B.22] Interviewee: would be willing to keep record of the produce that we donated, and through the USDA grant, they could provide, financial compensation. And just two weeks ago.
[B.23] Interviewee: I met her down in Location_17, and
[B.24] Interviewee: She cut me 5 checks in the amount of [Financial_Amount] of food that we had donated to these organizations. And so that… that's our…
[B.25] Interviewee: initial introduction to, a co-op, and I'm sure it has… Larger branches and bigger,
[B.26] Interviewee: advantages to… for us to explore. So again, this is new to us.
[C.17] Interviewer: Ariza.
[B.27] Interviewee: Yes, sir.
[C.18] Interviewer: If I could just add real quick,
[C.19] Interviewer: Last week, Ariza's JAG program And our program
[C.20] Interviewer: Started the initial discussion to do a…
[C.21] Interviewer: A informal cooperative to teach the kids
[C.22] Interviewer: How to start and to operate and sustain
[C.23] Interviewer: a cooperative, so I'm looking forward to that. Is that something we're still doing, Ariza?
[B.28] Interviewee: Yes.
[B.29] Interviewee: Yes.
[C.24] Interviewer: Yeah, anyway, I just thought I'd add that.
[B.30] Interviewee: Yeah, thank you.
[A.20] Interviewer: That's wonderful.
[A.21] Interviewer: Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off. Were there other people that were speaking?
[B.31] Interviewee: Nope.
[A.22] Interviewer: So, the second half of that is,
[A.23] Interviewer: So as long as, you know, you're talking about, like, where your cooperative is located, what is the purpose, mission of the cooperative?
[C.25] Interviewer: Is that just for anybody?
[A.24] Interviewer: It is…
[C.26] Interviewer: Okay.
[C.27] Interviewer: Yeah, I don't… myself, personally, I don't…
[C.28] Interviewer: I'm not operating a cooperative myself, we just help bring
[C.29] Interviewer: train and… and bring awareness to Organization_7, at least that was the initial, you know, goal, the objective on our part for the center of… for Organization_18. So…
[C.30] Interviewer: And we've had a lot of success with
[C.31] Interviewer: meeting with different individuals throughout our community who are interested and have received the training from us. But I'll wait my turn. I'll tell my story with Pamela.
[C.32] Interviewer: In a little more detail.
[D.3] Interviewee: Yeah, the,
[D.4] Interviewee: it would seem, being on the cusp in terms of there's a lot of entrepreneurship in… within Macy.
[D.5] Interviewee: And the… and there… there are smaller co-ops, I believe. Barry, who was with the… the chickens, who joined us with the, the eggs?
[D.6] Interviewee: She started her own business.
[C.33] Interviewer: Oh, is that, Person_8?
[D.7] Interviewee: Uzi.
[B.32] Interviewee: Yeah. Yes.
[D.8] Interviewee: there are… there are people who are, who have started, I believe, their own small businesses. I'm not… I don't know if it falls under a co-op, but I think the general community is looking for ways to…
[D.9] Interviewee: establish co-ops and small businesses, and there are none right now, and even the, understanding, we meet weekly with a group from, with people who do teach courses exactly how to start a co-op, and
[D.10] Interviewee: what surrounds that and that pathway, and support for how to bring it into a community, and what barriers may have existed that they don't already exist, since clearly the success around, Macy is evident in,

Page 3

[D.11] Interviewee: the population of, say, the high school not staying around because, say, the lack of opportunity, it's sort of more of a cyclical cycle of wondering how to actually get in, and as,
[D.12] Interviewee: Person_2 was saying, you know, the… starting with the, the greenhouse in the back and the vegetables, the…
[D.13] Interviewee: The interest is definitely there, and so we're looking to meet again, where we're gonna have, more of the…
[D.14] Interviewee: higher… the larger view of, sort of, why and how a co-op works on a high level, but then get into the nuts and bolts of actually how do you start? Where would you go from here, what resources are available, and…
[D.15] Interviewee: Successful ones that may be already happening around you, and
[D.16] Interviewee: bring that information. So, we are, we are at the very beginning of,
[D.17] Interviewee: Of co-ops, and bring that into the community.
[D.18] Interviewee: Person_3, how did… how did that… was that a… You add something to that?
[C.34] Interviewer: Yeah, yeah, I like what you said about we're on the cusp of it, because
[C.35] Interviewer: what was it, 2 days ago, I got a call.
[C.36] Interviewer: And,
[C.37] Interviewer: there's, two CNAs. One graduated from the… Organization_13. They're… they're… one of their pathways, was the CNA program. She…
[C.38] Interviewer: She finished it, now her mom's getting ready to finish hers at NICC.
[C.39] Interviewer: And so they have called me and said, can we start, exploring a cooperative? So there's just a lot of…
[C.40] Interviewer: Opportunities and people… You know?
[C.41] Interviewer: Interested in… in starting a cooperative, so…
[C.42] Interviewer: I'm excited. I'm excited about it, so…
[C.43] Interviewer: One way or the other, you know, we're gonna get them.
[C.44] Interviewer: I'll be sure.
[A.25] Interviewer: That's exciting. It's really exciting to see Location_7 these different types of movements, you know, just, people are hearing about it, and they're gaining interest, or, you know, like, they're gaining interest in working with the cooperative, and they're bringing their different talents and resources. It's really exciting.
[C.45] Interviewer: Yes, it is.
[A.26] Interviewer: That's wonderful.
[A.27] Interviewer: So, if you… and I,
[A.28] Interviewer: I know you did your introductions. I don't know if Location_7 of you shared your different roles and positions, and I know that these things, you know, potentially change over time. We just do things, you know, like, if we see a need, we just do it.
[A.29] Interviewer: So, if you're able to discuss your current role or position, and then potentially how it's changed over time as well.
[C.46] Interviewer: Well, I'll go first.
[C.47] Interviewer: And again, as you can tell, I can't wait to talk to Location_10, or Pamela, I'm sorry.
[C.48] Interviewer: Person_5, but I am… I am proud to say
[C.49] Interviewer: And, of course, I still got…
[C.50] Interviewer: obviously some more training to do, but as of that first cohort… cohort, I'm, A cooperative Organization_47.
[C.51] Interviewer: I'm proud to give myself that title now. Right, Pamela?
[D.19] Interviewee: She's nodding her head, I'm sure.
[C.52] Interviewer: Are you, Pamela?
[D.20] Interviewee: There you go, you got the thumbs up.
[C.53] Interviewer: Alright, alright, well… And… and again, it… it… It's been a challenge.
[C.54] Interviewer: But, like anything, you know, I'm always inspired by, what I would call Patience and long-suffering, you know?
[C.55] Interviewer: And I think… from a leadership perspective, I think we're doing… And… and… analyzing
[C.56] Interviewer: are problem solving some of these barriers, and I want to…
[C.57] Interviewer: I want to thank Sam for his expertise, and it was important for us to… to…
[D.21] Interviewee: as I like the word, strategic.
[C.58] Interviewer: You know, we had to put a team together that could make the case, so to speak. So,
[C.59] Interviewer: Person_5 and Judy, we're still fighting here, and… and I think we're… we're… we're making ground, we're covering ground, so…
[C.60] Interviewer: Again, my role… I wasn't too involved with the school, and I'm glad you guys showed up. Brother-in-law.
[B.33] Interviewee: and Ariza, thank you guys for showing up.
[C.61] Interviewer: And sharing your story, because you got a beautiful story.
[C.62] Interviewer: But I'm also glad that we could, you know, coordinate and… and I look forward to working with you guys, and especially with the kids, so…
[C.63] Interviewer: My role kind of, extends. I'm also, a liaison between maybe Organization_36 and the community back to, Organization_17 and the
[C.64] Interviewer: Organization_33 at UNL, so it… that's kind of how… how my position grew, and I'm excited. I like what I do, and it's a challenge sometimes, but
[C.65] Interviewer: you know.
[C.66] Interviewer: not everything happens overnight, so that's why I threw that in. You know, sometimes it takes a little bit of patience and long suffering, and I'm just glad to be where I'm at.

Page 4

[C.67] Interviewer: Thank you.
[D.22] Interviewee: Yeah, thank you, Person_3. I will add, Person_3 wears many different hats, and one of the best hats that he does wear is that passion and enthusiasm as a member of the community.
[D.23] Interviewee: He doesn't stay vertical, he goes very horizontal and brings a lot of people together, and helps with, I mean, ultimately the… the council, being a very strong… you want that… you need that partner, in terms of the…
[D.24] Interviewee: economic standing within the community, and, Person_3 is able to, bridge that gap between peoples he brings in from many different communities and bring us Location_7 to the same table, which is, which is great.
[D.25] Interviewee: And doesn't stay siloed. He moves to wherever the momentum and how can I problem-solve this, and doesn't hide behind one hat, so he ends up wearing many of them, and thank you, Person_3. I am here today because of you. Appreciate it.
[C.68] Interviewer: I'm flattered, bro, thank you.
[B.34] Interviewee: Hey, this is Ricardo, and I want to share my role as a JAG employee. I'm the career specialist, and when Organization_10.
[B.35] Interviewee: I had a background in terms of knowing a little bit about the culture and the community.
[B.36] Interviewee: And I did a needs assessment with the students in the classroom, and they talked about the positives of the community. They talked about the, you know, the culture, the language, the music, the elders. They went on and on. A lot of pride.
[B.37] Interviewee: But at the same time, they talked about, you know, what needs to change in the community. They talked about the diabetes, the heart disease, the addictions, the poverty, and they were interested in coming up with
[B.38] Interviewee: solutions, and we talked about the concept of food is… is medicine, and that food, that's…
[B.39] Interviewee: healthy and available to the community, where this community is a food desert, and that's good, that's…
[C.69] Interviewer: Dave.
[C.70] Interviewer: It just hasn't…
[B.40] Interviewee: about that?
[B.41] Interviewee: But the, the, the meeting…
[C.71] Interviewer: Here.
[B.42] Interviewee: Organization_39 Tribal Council, and we had prepared the students to go and ask.
[C.72] Interviewer: figure it.
[B.43] Interviewee: Or 7 acres of land to farm.
[C.73] Interviewer: And, they came up with a very compelling.
[B.44] Interviewee: proposal, and Organization_36 agreed to lease, the school 7 acres of land
[B.45] Interviewee: And the term that they wanted to propose to us was that the term was for Location_7 of eternity.
[B.46] Interviewee: And they felt like, the growing of food and giving back to the community, was a viable solution.
[B.47] Interviewee: Another solution that we came up with was reframing the concept of resumes and teaching young people how to put together a resume when they don't have any job experience.
[B.48] Interviewee: However, in this community, they have a very strong, cultural, as well as values and beliefs, and so their resumes are based on Organization_12 values and beliefs.
[B.49] Interviewee: And so, that's much more marketable in this community than going outside the community, or…
[C.74] Interviewer: Saying that…
[B.50] Interviewee: They have experience flipping french fries for McDonald's.
[B.51] Interviewee: That has no value here. But,
[B.52] Interviewee: Those are some things that, we had done,
[B.53] Interviewee: In meetings, and talking to people. And then let me…
[B.54] Interviewee: I want to call Richard in for a second. He's problem solving out here in the hallway.
[B.55] Interviewee: But in my conversations with the JAG people.
[B.56] Interviewee: They had a curriculum, and that curriculum just…
[B.57] Interviewee: It couldn't be a cookie-cutter curriculum that was introduced to this community and said, okay, we're going to,
[B.58] Interviewee: You're one sort of… Besides the computer.
[B.59] Interviewee: Are you done with that
[B.60] Interviewee: Okay, you could work on that, okay? We're in school, we have students, so… Yep.
[B.61] Interviewee: But, what was I saying?
[B.62] Interviewee: the, richard, could you talk about how we got started in terms of,
[C.75] Interviewer: anything.
[B.63] Interviewee: the blessing and the prayer, and did you begin with that? Yeah, so, I mean, to really…
[B.64] Interviewee: understand what we're doing and where we're going. You kind of need to understand our story, even as far as it goes to
[B.65] Interviewee: how it spiraled to where it's at today. I mean, grew, blossomed, however you'd like to say it.
[B.66] Interviewee: Originally what Ricardo had said, he met with the students and those types of things, and through that, there was a couple other programs in the school, the outside classroom, a few staff members there that Location_7 had this… this vision, this… this thought of this garden, of showing our children how to grow things.
[B.67] Interviewee: So we kind of Location_7 collaboratively met and come up with this idea of, yes, we're going to do this garden.
[B.68] Interviewee: The staff at that time
[B.69] Interviewee: wanted to reach out to somebody to say a prayer, traditionally amongst the Maha, in the early spring, around the time of the thunder, when that thunder comes back and awakens this creation.
[B.70] Interviewee: There was a prayer said by a certain clan member, a certain elder.

Page 5

[B.71] Interviewee: So we, we gathered our children. We, at that time, in our Organization_15.
[B.72] Interviewee: My father-in-law, Person_9, who, creator called him home, At that time, he…
[B.73] Interviewee: Had said a prayer for us down there, and he brought the children down there, and he was telling us the prayer.
[B.74] Interviewee: Here's the, here's an actual, like, silhouette of…
[B.75] Interviewee: Person_9, during one of his pictures that he, had actually said a prayer.
[C.76] Interviewer: Oh, sinister stuff.
[B.76] Interviewee: And at that time, he… he said that prayer with our children. He wrote a… he wrote a tobacco and a corn husky, and he said that prayer, and he,
[B.77] Interviewee: brought Location_7 our children there, and at that time, there was… there was little… there was birds, large birds flying around us. At that time, I kind of was thinking, those are… those look like they're buzzers. This time of year, those buzzers around, but there were some pictures that were taken, and they were actually, immature bald eagles.
[B.78] Interviewee: they were, they were talking. They were, they were making their noises and, speaking to us amongst the children, and Person_9 said, acknowledge it right there. He said, look, he said, those young birds are acknowledging you. He's got to share that with the children.
[B.79] Interviewee: You couldn't have scripted it any better, so no one could have wrote that any better than what it was. Then at that time, Person_10, who actually currently works in our,
[B.80] Interviewee: Organization_15, and he explained a couple things to the children about how, during this time of year, there was
[B.81] Interviewee: there was an offering made that a certain clan member, he would take that seed, and he would put that seed in his mouth. That clan member is the same member that my brother-in-law comes from, the Latada people.
[B.82] Interviewee: They would take that seed, and they would put it in their mouth, and they would spit it in the four directions, and that was an offering to the birds, to the… to, different, creatures of this creation, to, have pity on our…
[C.77] Interviewer: on our crops.
[B.83] Interviewee: And then at that time, they would take the staff, and it would connect… they would put that in the ground and point that in the four directions. That was culminating, bringing the creation and the sky, together, and that was an awakening and everything.
[B.84] Interviewee: Our children wouldn't have been able to come by that… those types of cultural teachings and those stories if this thought wasn't…
[B.85] Interviewee: brought forth by Ricardo and the kids of wanting this garden. So that was, like, the very beginning of that prayer, and ever since then, we follow those practices. And when it comes to harvest season, that year he was able to say a harvest prayer for us.
[B.86] Interviewee: then we took gifts to the elders, and we presented them with some of the bounties of our growth, the corn, the squashes, different vegetables, some sage, different things. We took that, gifted them to them, and thanks of the prayer that was said.
[B.87] Interviewee: And then every year since, we teach our children that
[B.88] Interviewee: That part of having to go to an elder, and that person that you're going to say that prayer before we plant, before we turn that soil up, they ask them… they present them tobacco, and they ask them to say those prayers over the garden.
[B.89] Interviewee: And then… and in turn, they…
[B.90] Interviewee: We do ultimately do that, end of the season harvest prayer for us. Currently, we're using, Mr. Person_11. He's my nephew.
[B.91] Interviewee: He's a member of the Alatada clan, and he, he does that. He works here within the school, so this vision, this thought has brought this team
[B.92] Interviewee: Together in different aspects of every part that is needed, that we're here, and we're able to share that with the kids.
[B.93] Interviewee: That's kind of how it Location_7…
[B.94] Interviewee: from my thought, how it started, and it has evolved so much from planting a garden. When we said we're gonna plant a garden, I'm thinking, okay, this 30 by 30 square foot area, we're gonna put a couple pumpkins, some tomato plants, a couple peppers. No, year one, we did 7 acres, you know, that's…
[B.95] Interviewee: It was, like, mind-blowing, you know, about how it worked out, how it actually
[B.96] Interviewee: Evolved to what it is today is really something… Yeah.
[B.97] Interviewee: That is a…
Person_1, sorry.
[B.98] Interviewee: Next year, it will be at, 21 acres? Yeah, 21 acres.
[A.30] Interviewer: That is exciting, that is so amazing. That's Location_7 that I was going to say, it's just that it's just amazing how that, you know, like, the initial plan, or, like, thoughts of, like, where it would go, and then it was so much more.
[A.31] Interviewer: That you initially planned for, and so…
[B.99] Interviewee: It has evolved into… Just a traditional farm where, Indigenous,
[B.100] Interviewee: food sovereignty and security to… we're learning… I mean, it's evolving, it's growing into, like, almost a full immersion within the school of different, like, science program,
[B.101] Interviewee: the culinary, different programs are picking this up and using it within their normal day-to-day curriculum. Our produce, our… the soil dynamics, you know, Location_7 those types of things, even onto the business end, where our children are learning the business part of this, still being a person that,
[B.102] Interviewee: people that are doing this about the food and what it means to us, but still teaching them 21st century, second century ideas and practices of business. This can be an opportunity for us to do that, and even with
[B.103] Interviewee: From vegetable gardening to corn to, trees and berries, those… That…
[B.104] Interviewee: Avenue to… now we're talking live… small-scale livestock processing, Location_7 those types of things, but what that whole thing encompasses, and the vision of that.
[C.78] Interviewer: You know, I think it's also important for us to share that who are…
[B.105] Interviewee: friendships with different universities, different community leaders. They have brought so many gifts to the table, and have blessed us.
[B.106] Interviewee: And, you know, we had no idea, that this…
[B.107] Interviewee: local farmer was going to bring his, you know, tractor down. We don't have heavy equipment. He brought his tractor down and his planter, and planted seed for us. And, I mean, that's just one example. And again, through the power of friendship.
[B.108] Interviewee: We have been able to… move this.
[B.109] Interviewee: I mean, far… far ahead, years ahead of where we thought we would be. And, the state has a farm-to-school conference
[B.110] Interviewee: And they found out what we were doing, and they said, well, come speak at our conference. We need you Location_7 to share what you're doing. And they were completely blown away by the progress that we've made in a very, very short amount of time.
[B.111] Interviewee: In April, we're invited to go out to Organization_6 and speak to Indigenous schools out there. And so, again, those…
[B.112] Interviewee: Those opportunities are blessings, and… You know, there's no… We have a strong team.
[B.113] Interviewee: This doesn't… isn't owned by one person. It's a lot of people who are giving their gifts, and that's… that's truly, you know, how we've developed. So, I have to share that.
[C.79] Interviewer: Dude, you got some problems.

Page 6

[A.32] Interviewer: That is exciting. Thank you for sharing that.
[A.33] Interviewer: it's really, you know, amazing to think about where things are, and I'm sure, like, in the process, you've, overcome different challenges that, that maybe weren't, initially identified. You know, you're thinking, like, okay, as we're starting these things up, you know, we're going to face these different challenges.
[A.34] Interviewer: Yet, how did you work with them? How did you… Yeah, figure things out.
[B.114] Interviewee: You know, heat was a major, barrier, and, you know, the kids going out there and working in that extreme heat, and, we were able to get different organizations, the universities, medical.
[B.115] Interviewee: Medically trained physicians who came and provided, heat safety.
[B.116] Interviewee: And how to identify heat exhaustion in themselves and in others, and so that, we can stay safe.
[B.117] Interviewee: Out there, in the field. And so,
[B.118] Interviewee: That's one thing that just pops up in my mind as you ask that question.
[B.119] Interviewee: So, one of the things that this garden actually does is, when I talk about the prayer of the, traditionally the Umaha
[B.120] Interviewee: say a prayer before the hard… or before the planting, the turning of the soil, and that… that… that is actually called the… that whole practice is called the… the meepahanga of that, giving honor to that, that, that rebirth of this, creation.
[B.121] Interviewee: And then, ultimately, at the end of the season, the harvest, there's a celebration that the Umaha have. It's the oldest, celebration, in the, in the nation, the, the, terawachi.
[B.122] Interviewee: the annual, I believe it was the 200 and…
[B.123] Interviewee: 21st? 21st, 22nd, something, along the annual, harvest celebration, and ultimately that one is, giving thanks, and then there's prayers said that are ceremonies that take place during that celebration that acknowledge this food, that give thanks to the Creator.
[B.124] Interviewee: And, prayers that are said that that food will be here for us, for our children.
[C.80] Interviewer: Yeah.
[B.125] Interviewee: Location_7 the way back from Location_4 So,
[B.126] Interviewee: That… that whole part in that… at that harvest celebration, our children are able to gather Location_7 the… the vegetables, the produce that they grow, the traditional corn that we use, and they… they make a meal comp…
[B.127] Interviewee: Made up of Location_7 the vegetables, the fruits, the corn that they've actually harvested, and then they make different breads, different, soups, different, you know, just different foods, and then that's offered to the, given to the people, shared with the people.
[B.128] Interviewee: Last year, we were able to do a Location_11 calling.
[B.129] Interviewee: our game and parks here. We were able to go down in the early morning. We got the appropriate client people to take care of that for us. Really beautiful ceremony that took place right there at sunrise.
[B.130] Interviewee: Again, couldn't script it any better.
[B.131] Interviewee: My father-in-law, Person_12.
[B.132] Interviewee: senior, he said that prayer, and the moon was still up, and the sun was rising at the same time. There was light snow across the whole creation.
[B.133] Interviewee: He was able to say that prayer right there at the… and our kids got to witness that, acknowledge that, that the masculinity of the sun and the feminist part of this creation of that moon, and it was Location_7 encompassed in one prayer, and then the harvest of that Location_11.
[B.134] Interviewee: And then we used that Location_11, we brought it back to the school, our children got to harvest it, butcher it, and prepare it, and then that meat was actually used in the meal of the… at the headwatching.
[B.135] Interviewee: So, but moving forward, we have goals and plans with the Location_11. Like I said, this Location_7 started with that prayer that my father-in-law Rufus said, and it's Location_7 evolved, and it's really growing into something where there's opportunities for our children in Location_7 aspects of this.
[B.136] Interviewee: Well, that's another part. I'll… I guess I'll continue to chime in on Ricardo's… trying to find some pictures and videos to share with them.
[B.137] Interviewee: Nope.
[A.35] Interviewer: This is great, you know, thank you for… for sharing those… those pieces of information of those.
[C.81] Interviewer: That sounds great.
[A.36] Interviewer: Those, those times that those, different parts really came together.
[A.37] Interviewer: thank you for sharing that today. I was just sharing with Pamela that, I'm really appreciative of, like, you know, the different things as you continue to share.
[A.38] Interviewer: About, like, how you're getting started and how you're moving forward, and how you've overcome different challenges and obstacles, things that, you know, that you didn't anticipate, but with Location_7 of your skills, you know, you're just able to, like, work with it to make it still happen.
[C.82] Interviewer: be supervised.
[A.39] Interviewer: So, along with that, how did the community learn about the cooperative, and… and what it… what it can do?
[C.83] Interviewer: household itself.
[B.138] Interviewee: You know, we, we have regular farmers markets out in front of school, and we sell our produce.
[C.84] Interviewer: scan.
[B.139] Interviewee: There's a big, cheap store that's inside of our school, and
[B.140] Interviewee: we have this huge billboard out in front of the school that advertises when we're going to be open and what we have available. Last year, we harvested over 300 quarts of corn.
[B.141] Interviewee: And that corn, sold out.
[B.142] Interviewee: We harvested in August. By the end of September,
[B.143] Interviewee: We sold out of our corn.
[B.144] Interviewee: 30 days, we were done selling 300 quarts of corn, and
[B.145] Interviewee: We were very… the students were very proud of the fact that they got to learn how to, process that corn, how to harvest that corn in the traditional way.
[B.146] Interviewee: And to spoon it, and to blanch it, and then to dry it, and then package it. I mean, it is a,
[B.147] Interviewee: tedious, long process. But again.
[B.148] Interviewee: The importance of doing it in the traditional way has great value to the community, and when we sold the corn to the community members, they asked the students, well.
[B.149] Interviewee: how did you do this? And they explained to the community member, well, we were taught how to build the screens, we were taught how to do these certain things, how to spoon it, and
[B.150] Interviewee: you know, you can see the smiles on the faces of the grandmas, you know, saying, that's how we learned how to do it, you know, and

Page 7

[B.151] Interviewee: Again, that, there's great value in maintaining those traditions.
[A.40] Interviewer: Thank you, that's powerful.
[A.41] Interviewer: That's really important.
[A.42] Interviewer: Mr. Valentino, you joined us,
[A.43] Interviewer: After we had already started, are you able to introduce yourself?
[A.44] Interviewer: And then we can hear from the others.
[B.152] Interviewee: Yeah, I… I… I'm… I'm…
[A.45] Interviewer: on the same screen as Ricardo. Oh, okay.
[B.153] Interviewee: I'm just trying to… I'm gonna attempt to share my screen with some pictures and different things, so I've logged in on my laptop.
[A.46] Interviewer: Got it, okay, that makes… okay. If you want me to talk about my brother-in-law Barry, I can't. Right, exactly.
[A.47] Interviewer: That's wonderful.
[C.85] Interviewer: I'll listen to him.
[A.48] Interviewer: Don't listen to it!
[A.49] Interviewer: So as you're… oh, were you gonna say something, Mr, or Sam?
[D.26] Interviewee: No.
[A.50] Interviewer: Oh, okay.
[A.51] Interviewer: So, as you are thinking about Location_7 of these different strides and the ways that you've moved, that you've moved with your cooperative to make it successful.
[A.52] Interviewer: Do your bylaws, have they changed over time? Do they, how do they account for these different, measures for distributing profits?
[B.154] Interviewee: I'm sorry, could you repeat that again?
[A.53] Interviewer: Do your bylaws provide measures for distributing profits?
[A.54] Interviewer: Like, do your members decide the, the dividend amounts, or does that come internally from,
[A.55] Interviewer: The board, or how does that work?
[B.155] Interviewee: Right now, in terms of the cooperative, we are…
[B.156] Interviewee: Just in the very beginning convers…
[B.157] Interviewee: conversation of starting this with, Person_3, but…
[C.86] Interviewer: In the classroom, the students.
[B.158] Interviewee: in JAG have voice and choice.
[B.159] Interviewee: And so, in setting the prices for the corn, the students set the price last year, and they set the price this year. And so, we explained to the students, you know, that, you know, prices have gone up, the cost of, you know, gas and
[B.160] Interviewee: You know, transportation, Location_7 these things.
[B.161] Interviewee: are continuing to increase, so we have to… if we can… if we're going to stay viable, we're going to have to raise our prices a little bit. And so, again, the students…
[B.162] Interviewee: Pulled that power at this time.
[C.87] Interviewer: Chris, just let me pop.
[C.88] Interviewer: I think it's zero.
[A.56] Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that.
[B.163] Interviewee: Diffin?
[A.57] Interviewer: Do you have, something else to add to that, Mr. Webster?
[C.89] Interviewer: No, I don't.
[A.58] Interviewer: Okay.
[A.59] Interviewer: So, did your cooperative establish conflict resolution, as part of your bylaws?
[A.60] Interviewer: Or how did you… how do you manage that?
[A.61] Interviewer: Especially since there's so many community members that are part of… that can be part of this, that may direct some of that. How did your cooperative establish conflict resolution?
[B.164] Interviewee: I guess the JAG program, they ultimately kind of oversee
[B.165] Interviewee: They do, when school starts every year, they do form a board, elect a president. They are students, they ultimately… this is their garden, this is their project. They make the decisions, so any… any large
[B.166] Interviewee: Decisions come up. The administration of the school makes the majority of decisions.
[B.167] Interviewee: But when it comes to the small… when I say decisions of the administration, that's more policy and those types of things, but when it comes to resolving issues that are happening down in the garden, that's usually brought to the board of the student JAG board.
[B.168] Interviewee: And an example of that is the funding to pay the students
[B.169] Interviewee: during the summer. We received funding from Organization_34, and the students would make minimum wage, work 4 hours a day.
[B.170] Interviewee: And at the end of summer, they would have the potential to earn up to [Financial_Amount] for summer employment.
[B.171] Interviewee: Organization_22 has a process, an application process, that each student had to fill out a 22-page application, and I would spend 2 months helping them to get through
[B.172] Interviewee: You know, page by page by page.

Page 8

[B.173] Interviewee: and… Our team here at the school talked about it and said, you know what? We need to find
[B.174] Interviewee: different funding.
[B.175] Interviewee: And so, we've been out searching for different funding, and the goal is for us to have a two-page application where the parent signs it one time, not eight times. Again, at this point in their development,
[B.176] Interviewee: Applying for a job should not be… punitive.
[B.177] Interviewee: It should be a positive interaction, it should be a positive communication, and we need to encourage our young people to develop a strong work ethic and to learn skills.
[A.62] Interviewer: Absolutely, that's important.
[D.27] Interviewee: So, as part of…
[A.63] Interviewer: Oh, sorry, go ahead.
[D.28] Interviewee: Oh, I was just gonna say, as…
[D.29] Interviewee: Co-ops are beginning within the community very,
[D.30] Interviewee: being instrumental with Organization_27, I understand that there's a new election coming, so we're gonna have a flip of leadership, and Barry's instrumental in terms of negotiating
[D.31] Interviewee: or even putting on the radar that co-ops are coming, and so subjects like bylaws, do they dictate profits and such. I think he's already started the wheels, so the next administration that comes in
[D.32] Interviewee: will actually have this already on their plate and work together with Barry. So I would say he's already providing support and…
[D.33] Interviewee: resolution for an issue that could come out if we tried it two months from now and said, oh, by the way, this is happening in the community. It'd be a little harder, perhaps, to… to adopt.
[B.178] Interviewee: varies.
[B.179] Interviewee: So, I shared a picture of our garden.
[B.180] Interviewee: Just to let you, I, I don't know if anybody can see the screen.
[A.64] Interviewer: That's actually our guardian, our football field.
[B.181] Interviewee: And everything just to the south of there, the black mat, can everybody see it?
[A.65] Interviewer: Yes, thank you.
[B.182] Interviewee: Location_7 the way from this drainage ditch where my little marker's at.
[B.183] Interviewee: Everything inside of that, along the creek here, And then…
[B.184] Interviewee: Right up around here are shipping containers, our little meeting spot.
[B.185] Interviewee: This whole area is our garden.
[B.186] Interviewee: That 7 acres.
[B.187] Interviewee: Along the perimeter of that, we're actually currently installing a walking trail made of,
[B.188] Interviewee: mulch. There's 3,000 plants through a…
[B.189] Interviewee: I guess, a donation, reaching out and working our resources. Organization_8 and Parks was able to donate 3,000 Indigenous plants, elderberries, choke cherries, service berries, sand cherries.
[B.190] Interviewee: Wild plums.
[B.191] Interviewee: And those were planted along the whole exterior of that, of our garden. We have a high tunnel where my cursor's at, right there. We currently operate a high tunnel that was donated by Organization_35.
[B.192] Interviewee: They, they paid for everything. My maintenance staff actually installed that.
[C.90] Interviewer: For a while.
[B.193] Interviewee: We have a pollinator garden with Location_7 traditional plants, our traditional flowers in this area.
[B.194] Interviewee: Along the whole edge of that perimeter, there's multiple beehives and bee houses that was donated by Dr. Person_13 from Organization_29.
[C.91] Interviewer: the order.
[B.195] Interviewee: The majority of our vegetables are growing on the black… the big black mat there.
[B.196] Interviewee: And the rest of the area, there's 3 sections of traditional corn that we grow.
[B.197] Interviewee: the little line… the little boxes down in the corner here, those are actually raised garden beds. They're…
[B.198] Interviewee: 25 foot long by 6 foot wide. There's 9 of those.
[B.199] Interviewee: Then there's an additional mat down here where normally we grow watermelons, but we grow just about anything that can grow in our zone
[B.200] Interviewee: We grow those in this garden, I mean, like, on a large scale.
[B.201] Interviewee: I think this year we planted over a thousand tomato plants, so 4 different varieties.
[B.202] Interviewee: 10 different types of lettuce, 4 different types of zucchinis, multiple pumpkins, the corn… the…
[B.203] Interviewee: Like, 11 varieties of peppers, bell peppers… Beans, peas… Variety of squashes?
[B.204] Interviewee: So, and one of those is a pumpkin, a traditional pumpkin that was thought to have been, like, extinct, but through a dig, one of the professors, the doctors at UNL did
[B.205] Interviewee: on behalf of the… on behalf of the THPO program for Organization_37, in eastern Location_2, which was kind of the ancestral homelands of… of the Location_17, they were able to,
Person_2 a cache that was stored underground, and it had,
[B.206] Interviewee: Like, 7,000 pumpkin seeds in it?
[B.207] Interviewee: where they were able to take those back down to the UNL and propagate those, and out of those 7,000 seeds, 7
[B.208] Interviewee: Plants were able to be grown from those 6… over 600-year-old seeds.

Page 9

[B.209] Interviewee: And those are traditionally an Location_17 pumpkin. They're very similar to the pumpkin that Amanda and Richardson have, but today we're able to grow those and sell those on our farmer's market, use those in the culinary department.
[B.210] Interviewee: For our children to use that, so… They're making pumpkin pies? Pumpkin pies, making pumpkin pies out of those, making…
[B.211] Interviewee: And just different things with those. And then on the normal jack-o'-lantern pumpkins, today at 3 o'clock, we've grown enough pumpkins where we're gonna pull the trailer up by the front door, and Location_7 700-plus students in our school are gonna be able to take a pumpkin home with them.
[B.212] Interviewee: And then excess, last year, I think we were able to sell 300 to 500, jack-o'-lantern pumpkins.
[B.213] Interviewee: to different events and different people. So, there's a lot we do, like Ricardo did mention, our… R.
[B.214] Interviewee: farmer's market that we have here at the school, we're able… in the past, we're able to expand that a little bit and offer that farmer's market with our produce in different communities. Sioux City has a large farmer market. We took kids up there one time, and we offered several times the last couple summers.
[B.215] Interviewee: of the farmer's market over in Waltz Hill, so that cooperative.
[B.216] Interviewee: Deal we're working on is really, really, growing, and it's Location_7 really in the infancy stages here yet with this, but something we want to… we're striving for, we want to move forward with.
[B.217] Interviewee: But when you, when you start talking about
[B.218] Interviewee: the cooperative part, we can grow… I, I would, I would… Guess… guesstimate we probably grew…
[B.219] Interviewee: 200,000 pounds, if not double that, in produce, fish and vegetables, everything. Probably only able to capture, sell, and use
[B.220] Interviewee: a percentage, 2% of the total produce that was… was grown down there. We were able to use. The rest either went back into compost, or, really the frost got.
[B.221] Interviewee: moving forward, we're really looking at ways to try to process this in a better, more economical, feasible way for our children to do this, and then use our Chief Store, use our different avenues, like Organization_28 in Location_17, Organization_44.
[B.222] Interviewee: location in Location_17, the food distribution program, the WIC program, different programs are able to take our produce now, and so I guess that cooperative that we're growing there is really,
[B.223] Interviewee: going goods. We were able to take some of our early spring, we grew lettuce. We traded that with a guy
[B.224] Interviewee: Who grows,
[B.225] Interviewee: hydroponic tomatoes. He took some of our lettuce, and he traded us some tomatoes early, early spring before tomatoes were available. So, I guess… and he wanted to work things with us where he could buy some of our produce, so I guess there's… those things are kind of working… working out. We just really need to get those in an organized way, and…
[B.226] Interviewee: We had thoughts and visions. I mean, our football field, right next to our football field, that parking lot there.
[B.227] Interviewee: It's a one-way loop that goes in there, where at times there's been discussions of having our farmers market down there.
[B.228] Interviewee: and having… more of a…
[B.229] Interviewee: I guess, like, a flea market-style farmer's market, where other vendors or students would be able to sell vendor spots, and allow other growers, other people to come in and set up spots, and we'd have our… our farmer's market would be the showcase of that, and people could come in and do that. So I guess that's a…
[B.230] Interviewee: I wouldn't, you know. One other thing that we're…
[B.231] Interviewee: committed to doing is taking the, the metrics of, our students' height, weight,
[B.232] Interviewee: Body mass index, is it blood sugar? Blood sugars, and so we…
[B.233] Interviewee: have a commitment to do a 5-year study, and I'm gonna ask Richard to… to share a little bit of a…
[B.234] Interviewee: significant story about one of our young ladies who made significant changes. So, Person_2, could you please… So, yeah, there's always, in our story, in our… in our… in this garden, there's always… I try to really look at it outside the box from a different perspective.
[C.92] Interviewer: A lot of times, we're…
[B.235] Interviewee: We're in it, the heat of battle, I guess you want to say, getting this done.
[B.236] Interviewee: you don't really realize what's taking place, how large this is, how big of a deal, an impact this has on our community. We had… we did, year one, we had a student, she was… at the end of the school year, she was
[B.237] Interviewee: Diagnosed type 1 diabetes.
[B.238] Interviewee: Type 1 diabetes, she came in, she had to get an insulin pump put in.
[B.239] Interviewee: monitor her blood sugar. She came to the school, she shared with the staff and her classmates of what had taken place. They really kind of consoled her, talked to her, encouraged her, but it really motivated her to,
[B.240] Interviewee: to really go Location_7 in on the garden. She physically worked it. It made her health better.
[B.241] Interviewee: she… she ate the… Ricardo… Ricardo, at times during lunch, he'll make…
[B.242] Interviewee: the produce that we're growing, you know, share that with the students over a lunch period. She'd done that, she took a garden home, she grew a garden at her home, shared that with her family. So just in that short little period of time of over, like, 60 days, she went back. Originally, her A1C was, like, a 14, which the doctors were livid about.
[B.243] Interviewee: They said that's kidney failure range, and she went back, just in that 60, 70 days that we have this garden, and she had her A1C checked, and the… her A1C was below a 5.
[B.244] Interviewee: which the doctors were kind of confused about. They were like, okay, your lifestyle changes, what you've done, have really dramatically changed the approach of
[B.245] Interviewee: Of what we're gonna do moving forward, So,
[B.246] Interviewee: They, they, they, at that time, they thought, we're gonna have to remove this insulin pump.
[B.247] Interviewee: Whoa.
[B.248] Interviewee: we got back into hustle, bustle, school, everything started, the garden kind of got closed up, put to bed, and her A1C… her A1Cs went back up, her blood sugars went back up, eating that normal school food. So we had really thought, after that point of moving this food, this produce into our,
[B.249] Interviewee: our kitchen, or providing a school lunch. So, in turn, the state of Location_1 allows us… allows the school to buy… to use their school lunch money to purchase produce from us that can go back into the garden.
[B.250] Interviewee: So, last year we were successfully able to
[B.251] Interviewee: Put produce on our, salad bar.
[B.252] Interviewee: So, again, we're making those strives for co-ops and doing Location_7 those kind of things, and it's really working.
[A.66] Interviewer: Absolutely. Wow, that's a… that's… that's important, and…
[A.67] Interviewer: definitely grateful for you, for talking about that. I believe Pamela wants to, ask Barry a few questions, well, before he needs to leave.
[B.253] Interviewee: Thank you.
[A.68] Interviewer: Person_5, are you there?
[E.1] Interviewee: Yep, I'm there. I just had to figure Location_7 the buttons out. I love the story of what you have done with this school, and I was fortunate enough to tour and experience what you guys are doing there, and it's so groundbreaking for those youth that attend that school.

Page 10

[E.2] Interviewee: And…
[E.3] Interviewee: I feel like both Jodi and I, I just felt like my spirit got fed hearing the story about the seeds. You know, and we Location_7, each of us, from my nation, we have songs that we sing when we go out and we harvest plants.
[E.4] Interviewee: And how we pick them, you know, like wild, you know, gathered plants, and it just made my heart…
[E.5] Interviewee: Feels so good.
[E.6] Interviewee: To hear that, and that there's such a respect for that to be integrated into everything that you do, and it's not separated. It's a part of everything that you do.
[E.7] Interviewee: Person_3, I'm just gonna go through some questions with you, because…
[E.8] Interviewee: I know that you guys are looking at forming the cooperative.
[E.9] Interviewee: But can you tell us about what was the initial vision that brought your community together? And I think it… was it during COVID?
[C.93] Interviewer: Yeah, yeah, that was kind of the, as they say, the epiphany.
[C.94] Interviewer: And Person_4, don't be afraid to jump in here, because I know you've got a lot of insight.
[C.95] Interviewer: We're a team, Person_5.
[E.10] Interviewee: Yep. So, when you guys… I know that there was… there's a lot of partnerships that are involved in this. It's… you're not working in isolation, like Sam said, you're not in a silo.
[E.11] Interviewee: that you're, you know, you depend on partners. But when you did that first interview and brought the community together.
[E.12] Interviewee: What was the goal? Was it to introduce them to the notion of Organization_7, what people could do?
[E.13] Interviewee: I know that you did the food, sovereignty interviews with people in the community.
[E.14] Interviewee: Now, you're still talking to me, right? Yes, sir.
[C.96] Interviewer: Okay. Now, we… my mind's trying to go back, and one of the things I remember is,
[C.97] Interviewer: when I was first hired, we wanted to… We had to… We wanted feedback.
[C.98] Interviewer: And we wanted to know, you know, was there interest, you know, in Organization_7?
[C.99] Interviewer: And so, we… we did the traditional meal, we fed the community, which we had a great turnout.
[C.100] Interviewer: And then our survey… one of the… the survey… the… the feedback was… is there was…
[C.101] Interviewer: Tremendous interest in Organization_7.
[C.102] Interviewer: And today, you know, and I'm gonna jump ahead here, alright, if you don't mind, Person_5.
[E.15] Interviewee: No, that's fine.
[C.103] Interviewer: One of the things we recognize today is there's a lot of barriers.
[C.104] Interviewer: You know, there was great interest But at the same time.
[C.105] Interviewer: there was so many barriers that we didn't see. A lot of times, you dive into something, and it's kind of like, you don't realize that, wait a minute, there's a lot of interest, but what's holding everybody up?
[C.106] Interviewer: And why… why aren't we having the success
[C.107] Interviewer: And so, as we tried to…
[C.108] Interviewer: you know, as they say, scan the internal and external environment. You know, we wanted to know what were some of these barriers, and boy, little did we know, right, Sam?
[C.109] Interviewer: There was tremendous barriers.
[C.110] Interviewer: And this… this… even the mindset that… that I'm interested.
[C.111] Interviewer: But where do I get the money? The financing?
[C.112] Interviewer: And so, again, along with that… that great interest, we… we just… we've been able to really come together as a team, and one of the things I felt was important was we… we had to document
[C.113] Interviewer: In other words, I thought about metrics, but I thought about it in a different way. I said, why don't we tell this as a story?
[C.114] Interviewer: And so that's where Sam came in, and I'm trying to, you know… I guess Sam was very important to this… this process for me, because as Natives, they say we're… we learn differently, right?
[C.115] Interviewer: Well, again, sam came in, and you've seen some of his work.
[C.116] Interviewer: And I just think it's incredible. We'll be presenting to Organization_36 once they get the election settled here. The general election's coming up, so we're… we're preparing for this presentation because… and the reason why I bring this up is… is…
[C.117] Interviewer: It's kind of like… Putting the cart before the horse, that old saying, right, Jodi?
[C.118] Interviewer: Right?
[C.119] Interviewer: So…
[A.69] Interviewer: Yes.
[C.120] Interviewer: We've recognized and… and… the… the…
[C.121] Interviewer: some of the things… some of these things have to happen, and… and Organization_36 is so important, so the strategy was to include the
[C.122] Interviewer: the buy-in… from Organization_36, and I think… I think we're… we're there.
[C.123] Interviewer: And again, more importantly, I think it was… was, as I've interviewed people.
[C.124] Interviewer: You know, I've recognized that, wait a minute, you know, these guys want to start a brick and mortar, right, Location_10? Or Pamela?
[C.125] Interviewer: So if somebody wants to start a brick and mortar, they have the finances, and they come in, they don't even know where to go, right, Sam?
[C.126] Interviewer: I mean, there… honestly, so, we've recognized that, whoa, wait a minute.
[C.127] Interviewer: if you… if you have… if you write a business plan, you know, where do you go? And so, I… I keep mentioning that because we have to…

Page 11

[C.128] Interviewer: create this pathway. And so that's where you see Sam's drawings, and we're trying to create this
[C.129] Interviewer: This… this document that says, listen, here's where we're at.
[C.130] Interviewer: And, and I, I, I loved, the story about Ho-Chump.
[C.131] Interviewer: And I have a tremendous amount of respect for what they've done, but we also recognize that our story is different.
[C.132] Interviewer: In how we approach this.
[C.133] Interviewer: So… Anyway, I kind of rambled there, but… did that…
[D.34] Interviewee: No, not at Location_7, and just to add on to that, Person_3,
[D.35] Interviewee: it was, a box labeled co-op, you know, put in the middle of the community, was not gonna do anything, and that was part of the discovery. And much of the work, and I have never…
[D.36] Interviewee: gone soup to nuts with a co-op. I don't pretend to know about them, but there certainly was a lot of work which preceded, sort of, the groundbreaking and flourishing of that, and that was very cultural and community-based, and to Barry's point, it was
[D.37] Interviewee: we've been meeting for months and months, and, you know, well, where are the co-ops? And it was a big exploration of barriers, not knowing they existed, when Barry was able to bring the right people together and the right
[D.38] Interviewee: frame of mind to realize that this is a way to help our community, and it's going to happen. And it's happening in the school, to Ricardo's point, and you can see it literally growing, and so…
[D.39] Interviewee: Person_3 being a fuel for that revealed more than just, you know, where do we go for, you know, how do I start? It was, how do I even start considering it within the community and Location_7 the players involved?
[D.40] Interviewee: in.
[E.16] Interviewee: it's planting seeds, and sometimes it takes a while. Some… I planted some seeds here, and my friend said, Pam, they won't show up until next year. I went, what? And, you know, and she said, wait, they'll come back, they'll be there next year. They didn't come up this year, but they'll be there next year. And so.
[E.17] Interviewee: It's that finding that sweet spot, because I think that we've… with Organization_7, we feel like there's, like, a one-size-fits-Location_7, and there isn't.
[E.18] Interviewee: So, you looking at your community, and even looking at it comparing to Ho-Chunk.
[E.19] Interviewee: it's not apples and oranges, and your people have different practices, and, you know, that's one of the things that I love about Organization_7, is the fact that we can adapt.
[E.20] Interviewee: to what works for our community. Not that, prescribed roadmap for developing a co-op.
[E.21] Interviewee: But what's gonna work for us? And, you know, so I…
[E.22] Interviewee: I like that you're doing that approach, and even the interest that you're getting right now is… those are those seeds that you've planted.
[E.23] Interviewee: They're starting to come up.
[E.24] Interviewee: And sometimes there's almost like a violence when a seed comes out of the ground. You know, it's gotta handle rain and wind and heat, and it gets battered to Location_7 get out, and then… then it starts to… it takes root, and the stem gets stronger.
[E.25] Interviewee: And it's that, you know, you were talking about being, I…
[E.26] Interviewee: being patient or long-suffering, I don't remember the… quite the word that you used, Person_3, but it… it is, it's that patience to allow those things to grow in people's minds, and then for them to see themselves.
[E.27] Interviewee: in that picture of what can I do? How can we work together, you know, as a community, that it's… it's for Location_7 of us, you know,
[E.28] Interviewee: And I know you have the passion to…
[E.29] Interviewee: to take it there. I want to ask you a question about
[E.30] Interviewee: how do you feel? Like, I look at the school and Location_7 the experts that they have working there, you know, and the work that they're doing by allowing each person with their gifts.
[E.31] Interviewee: to… just flourish, you know, for those youth that they're serving. And…
[E.32] Interviewee: how do you… how do you feel the importance of your role in learning, like, your partnership with Organization_26 in their cooperative development, rural affairs, but learning how to be a co-op, a native co-op developer in your own community, how do you feel
[E.33] Interviewee: the ne… How important do you feel that is for the success of this happening in our communities?
[C.134] Interviewer: Well, I… you know, Person_5, let me say this, that, you know, and I'm glad you got to that one, because that's the one I've been kind of thinking about. What is she going to say, and what did she… and… and so…
[C.135] Interviewer: I feel… That… that that was very important for our community.
[C.136] Interviewer: Because, number one, you know, I've always, the last 3 years.
[C.137] Interviewer: I've always jokingly teased Location_10 and said, Location_10, wow, I didn't realize people have no clue about Organization_7.
[C.138] Interviewer: And… and I have a little saying, Organization_7 make the world turn, right? Right, Pamela?
[C.139] Interviewer: I… I… there's… in… in Location_12, I have a friend who says there's a cooperative down the… they're one of the largest tea growers
[C.140] Interviewer: in the world, and they're here in Location_12.
[E.34] Interviewee: Mmm.
[C.141] Interviewer: And he says, it's a cooperative, so that's what you do. And anyway, I just found that interesting, Person_5, that… that as I'm…
[C.142] Interviewer: Aging in this field.
[C.143] Interviewer: That would be one of my goals, so I think it's vital that your program, you know, reach
[C.144] Interviewer: the native, because that's… that would be something I would love to see from some of our kids coming out of the school program, you know, that you can grow and be innovative in the field of Organization_7.
[C.145] Interviewer: So, anyway… I don't know if I answered your question.
[E.35] Interviewee: No, you did, you did,
[E.36] Interviewee: you know, I have a question. How do you feel the community interacts with you?
[E.37] Interviewee: In the area of cooperative development, how do you feel they're reacting to you, or interacting with you now?
[E.38] Interviewee: Yes, they're learning.
[C.146] Interviewer: One of the things I came in with was, you know, I kept thinking about the marketing side of it.
[C.147] Interviewer: The awareness, that's one thing we realized what was important for us was to create awareness

Page 12

[C.148] Interviewer: And I'm one of those old-fashioned guys that's just gonna sit down and have a face-to-face with you. But I think it was also about, you know.
[C.149] Interviewer: having that trust, you know, I'm gonna go back to trust.
[C.150] Interviewer: And I believe I have that with my community. I've been blessed that way, to be able to have that trust with my community.
[C.151] Interviewer: We talk about, you know, years going back when, you know, Organization_30 had issue with the tribe, and then that was it. So it's vital that you have
[C.152] Interviewer: You know, those… those… that influence.
[C.153] Interviewer: You know?
[C.154] Interviewer: And so, thank you for that question, because that's… that's a skill that's not always, you know.
[C.155] Interviewer: Prevalent, you know, when it comes to trying to get outside organizations coming into our homelands, you know.
[C.156] Interviewer: Did that help, Pamela?
[E.39] Interviewee: Yes, sir.
[E.40] Interviewee: I… I'm just feeling like some of the things are not ready to answer completely, Person_1.
[E.41] Interviewee: because of… because they're at such a beginning stage, and one of the things that I… I do want to bring up is I really feel that graphic facilitation, it's a… it's a gift of…
[E.42] Interviewee: to me, How you hear things.
[E.43] Interviewee: And so you have to be listening so intently.
[E.44] Interviewee: As you're drawing what you're hearing, and it's like.
[E.45] Interviewee: Oh my gosh, you know, that's a skill set.
[E.46] Interviewee: To be able to, listen to what the people are saying, you're not driving an agenda.
[E.47] Interviewee: You're listening, and you're writing what you're hearing, you know, from the community, and I feel like we need to include that in the training that we're going to be doing for Organization_32 developers. I feel like that has to be a part of it.
[E.48] Interviewee: Because one of the things that we focused on very early on was trust.
[E.49] Interviewee: We probably spent the first 5 sessions, it was Location_7 about building trust.
[E.50] Interviewee: And then, how to facilitate in your community.
[E.51] Interviewee: Because sometimes, I mean, our native communities, I love them, but holy buckets, it's like herding cats.
[E.52] Interviewee: And, you know, you've got to know how to, you know, you've got to know how to keep people on task, and then we have people that come in, and they have an agenda.
[E.53] Interviewee: Maybe because you thought it up before they did, they're offended, and so they come in and they want to disrupt what you're doing.
[E.54] Interviewee: And then you've got people that really want to be there, and, you know, it's like, it's Location_7 these different things, and people are at different levels of their own trauma in our communities, too. And how do we make space to create a safe space for people that are in that process of healing?
[E.55] Interviewee: You know, how do… how do we give them a voice? You know, but not let that voice take over everything, because that's where they happen to be at, you know? It's a… it's a lot of juggling, you know? In our communities, I feel like it's really different, because our communities are at such different places.
Person_5, emotionally, spiritually, and culturally, a lot of times, and physically, you know, so…
[E.56] Interviewee: I, you know, I'm afraid… I hope that Roberto isn't going to be upset with this interview, because it's a little bit different, but I feel like we got a lot of things answered about… from the school.
[E.57] Interviewee: Maybe it didn't apply to the cooperative, but it's really talking about those partnerships, it's talking about how we work together, how we look at other communities and other, you know, like, schools, co-ops, programs that are happening.
[E.58] Interviewee: And… I'm gonna let her ask the last questions.
[E.59] Interviewee: And, you know, I think a really important question, I'm just gonna lay it out for everyone to think about.
[E.60] Interviewee: And maybe not use the word cooperative, but, what tools and resources Do you guys need?
[E.61] Interviewee: To, to continue to grow and prosper.
[E.62] Interviewee: And sustain the momentum that you have, like at the school.
[E.63] Interviewee: what Barry, what you're doing, and the partnership with Sam, that's a question I'd like you to have percolating, you know, and I'll let Jodi take the rest of this, and thank you for your answers. Do you feel I got enough from Barry, or should I squeeze him dry?
[A.70] Interviewer: I'm…
[C.157] Interviewer: Brave now, brave now, Person_5.
[A.71] Interviewer: Right, I know, I'm like, I don't know about squeezing him dry.
[E.64] Interviewee: Well, I don't know, I don't want to take that one last brain cell, because he's got to go back to work. I know.
[B.254] Interviewee: 3.
[C.158] Interviewer: You hear that? Brother-law, you hear that?
[E.65] Interviewee: True, true point, Pam. True point.
[E.66] Interviewee: Oh, I'm sorry, he teases me Location_7 the time. Yes. Him and that crazy… the corn stalkers.
[E.67] Interviewee: Okay, I'll let you get back to… you finish it up, my girl.
[A.72] Interviewer: Okay, thank you. Thank you so much, Person_5, that was…
[A.73] Interviewer: Those were wonderful questions, and, you know, really trying to think about, like, what we're doing, or, like, you know, Location_7 the knowledge that people are pulling together, and there's so much knowledge that's just sort of, like, you can just keep listening, yet…
[A.74] Interviewer: You know, my final question, you know, as part of what Pamela was asking previously, was thinking about global
[A.75] Interviewer: climate change, along with, like, COVID, you know, as, like, those are some major challenges.
[A.76] Interviewer: How did your groups deal with that?
[C.159] Interviewer: I'll let the school answer that one first.

Page 13

[B.255] Interviewee: We're… we… we've seen… we've seen…
[B.256] Interviewee: Just about every extreme you could in the last 5 years, Originally, our kids watered…
[B.257] Interviewee: The whole 7 acres with 5 gallon buckets.
[B.258] Interviewee: At that time, we were beginning stages of a drought.
[B.259] Interviewee: And they carried the water buckets anywhere from 100 to…
[C.160] Interviewer: Fuck.
[B.260] Interviewee: 300-400 yards per plant to water those. They did that every day, Location_7 day, and pull weeds. We kind of evolved along the way, and started to adapt a little bit.
[C.161] Interviewer: Without wine.
[B.261] Interviewee: secured funding to get in-ground irrigation in place. We just built that early, early spring this year.
[B.262] Interviewee: And then, this year, it didn't stop raining.
[B.263] Interviewee: you know,
[B.264] Interviewee: But the effects it has on the plants, as far as blights and different things that really… different pests and different… Location_7 those things that come with a drought, or the things that come with too much moisture, they're really…
[B.265] Interviewee: I mean, just magnified because of climate change. We're… we're 100%
[B.266] Interviewee: chemical-free. Hard to say organic anymore in today's age, but we are chemical-free. We try our best to limit the plastics, limit Location_7 those types of things, use composting.
[B.267] Interviewee: So, the climate change took a big part of it, so… but we've… we've learned a few other different techniques as far as how to mulch properly, how to… we're using some high tunnels, we plan on
[B.268] Interviewee: moving forward with more high tunnels, greenhouses, those types of things, so… it's really taken effect on us, and we've noticed it. I've grown… personally, I've had a garden at my home for over 25 years.
[B.269] Interviewee: So, just even in that.
[B.270] Interviewee: aspect, we really do see the changes and the effects of how tomatoes, how our vegetables, how our corn doesn't pollinate correctly, you know, Location_7 those things, and it's… a lot of it's due to climate change. Loss of… loss of certain pollinators, loss of, you know, too much intense sun, the droughts.
[B.271] Interviewee: Yeah, it, it, it… Fixing up that.
[A.77] Interviewer: Thank you. Thank you for sharing that.
[B.272] Interviewee: You know, can I add one more piece?
[B.273] Interviewee: In our very first year, when we planted our corn.
[B.274] Interviewee: And it came time for a harvest.
[B.275] Interviewee: Covid hit.
[B.276] Interviewee: And the reservation was closed down.
[B.277] Interviewee: And so… the raccoons, And the deer, and the birds.
[B.278] Interviewee: It was… it was their turn to harvest.
[B.279] Interviewee: We didn't get to harvest. They got fat that year.
[B.280] Interviewee: And… we just got to watch.
[B.281] Interviewee: We weren't allowed to go in… into the community to harvest.
[B.282] Interviewee: And so, that was a valuable… Lesson.
[B.283] Interviewee: That very first year. And,
[B.284] Interviewee: It was… it was an obstacle that we had to overcome, and we did, and we're in a different place.
[B.285] Interviewee: And there's so… I mean, like Richard said, there's abundance.
[B.286] Interviewee: the blessing of abundance. And, you know, we learned from a wonderful book called Organization_38.
[B.287] Interviewee: By Dr. Person_14.
[B.288] Interviewee: Honorable harvest, and we teach those principles of harvest.
[B.289] Interviewee: And, there was an organization called the Organization_19 invited her, it's a science museum, invited her to come
[B.290] Interviewee: and do a book reading. Well, they invited our students for a private reading, where our students got their books signed by Dr. Kimmerer, and I mean, again, it's those kinds of blessings and those kinds of teachings that are making a difference in the lives of our students.
[B.291] Interviewee: So I have to stop.
[B.292] Interviewee: I'm done.
[A.78] Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that.
[A.79] Interviewer: We're gonna… Mr. Webster, I don't know if you were going to share something?
[C.162] Interviewer: Yeah, can you… Can you repeat the question?
[A.80] Interviewer: Yes.
[C.163] Interviewer: Again, don't be afraid to jump in here, bud.
[A.81] Interviewer: Yes, and thinking of, like, the, the challenges of global climate change, and thinking about Location_7 those different impacts, you know, including COVID-19,
[A.82] Interviewer: How did your… How did your organizations work with that?
[C.164] Interviewer: Well, our… that was… in our case, you know, we've… we worked over Location_14.
[C.165] Interviewer: So, that, that was, something we had, you know, in our pocket already, so it…

Page 14

[C.166] Interviewer: It affected how we traveled and met.
[C.167] Interviewer: And obviously not in person, so we… we were very, you know, again, like any other organization, very remote.
[C.168] Interviewer: And… and before I forget,
[C.169] Interviewer: Person_5, if she's still on here, I think as it pertains to your question still, I think a lot of times, you know.
[D.41] Interviewee: the skills that are needed, I, I think, is…
[C.170] Interviewer: How to host, you know, a remote meeting, how to… how to conduct those type of meetings to keep everything on track.
[C.171] Interviewer: Person_5, are you still here?
[E.68] Interviewee: Yes, sir?
[C.172] Interviewer: Okay, so that… that was one… one thought I had.
[C.173] Interviewer: As, you know, the question pertains to how did we…
[C.174] Interviewer: how did we operate, basically, in the pandemic? And again, to our benefit, we were able to do this, you know, do Location_14, and so that was very helpful in terms of even meeting with people, individuals, as we were providing the training.
[C.175] Interviewer: on Organization_7.
[C.176] Interviewer: So, you know, we weren't… things went really well for us.
[C.177] Interviewer: Person_4, you want to highlight on that a little bit? I think you came in on a little bit of that.
[D.42] Interviewee: I can't think of any… you basically said it.
[C.178] Interviewer: Okay?
[D.43] Interviewee: You said everything I was gonna say, yes.
[C.179] Interviewer: Okay.
[D.44] Interviewee: Yeah.
[D.45] Interviewee: But it was neat, I think it was a,
[D.46] Interviewee: Some downtime that out of which, we're now having this conversation.
[C.180] Interviewer: That's great.
[D.47] Interviewee: That's it.
[A.83] Interviewer: Wonderful.
[A.84] Interviewer: It sounds like you're… you and your organizations have really, you know, worked with the challenges that were coming around, and, you know, definitely saw them as, like, things to work with versus, like, reasons to, like, shut down, or reasons to, like…
[A.85] Interviewer: not move forward, but instead, you know, that you worked with it, you brought your many talents to the table, and you're saying, okay, how can we troubleshoot this? How can we see this as, like, an opportunity to grow better, and to grow deeper?
[A.86] Interviewer: And so… Do you anticipate, you know, how do you think the future's going to look?
[C.181] Interviewer: Oh.
[C.182] Interviewer: I'll share some thoughts, you know, as we're… as I'm sitting here. Earlier, I thought about… and this goes back to Pamela. I don't know why she doesn't have her screen on.
[C.183] Interviewer: Oh.
[E.69] Interviewee: What's wrong with you, Pamela?
[D.48] Interviewee: What's wrong?
[E.70] Interviewee: It was supposed to be quiet, and I.
[C.184] Interviewer: And you know…
[E.71] Interviewee: I get talking, and then… poor Jodi.
[A.87] Interviewer: It's completely fine.
[C.185] Interviewer: Here's again some of my thoughts. One of the things I saw the school do, and I'm really proud of my school and these two gentlemen here, you know? What I saw them do
[C.186] Interviewer: Was be very innovative.
[C.187] Interviewer: in agile.
[C.188] Interviewer: And so, Person_5, those, you know, I couldn't put my finger on, you know.
[C.189] Interviewer: What do I want to tell Pamela, you know?
[C.190] Interviewer: And a lot of times, you end up… it's more like the responsibilities of a manager.
[C.191] Interviewer: You know what I mean?
[C.192] Interviewer: And… and when I mean innovative, I… I mean…
[C.193] Interviewer: So, your training, Person_5, has done this for me, because I often struggled with that. I thought, and what it taught me about…
[C.194] Interviewer: Be a native, and… and how we…
[C.195] Interviewer: We're this way, and we can still be this way. But I also know that it gave me this framework to think about within my own community. At the same time, I need the best of both worlds when it comes to training.
[A.88] Interviewer: And surprisingly.
[C.196] Interviewer: You know, sometimes I have to negotiate.
[C.197] Interviewer: So there's a lot of skill sets, Person_5, that… that you and I probably should talk about a little bit more in depth.

Page 15

[C.198] Interviewer: About your upcoming training, and those kind of things, so… Anyway… I thought I'd share that.
[E.72] Interviewee: I don't… I just have a quick question, because I'd asked that
[E.73] Interviewee: Was, what other tools and resources do you guys need?
[E.74] Interviewee: So you can continue to grow.
[E.75] Interviewee: And to, you know, sustain the work that you're doing.
[B.293] Interviewee: I… I… this is Richard again. I guess I have a couple things I've kind of been jotting down here when I… when I've been… we've been going through this. I understand it's about the cooperative and…
[B.294] Interviewee: Every,
[B.295] Interviewee: I guess I was a little thinking it was going to be a little bit different along the different lines, not really knowing about the cooperative. I'm very interested in it, you know, thinking of Barry and how he's doing this.
[B.296] Interviewee: how, you know, moving forward, how do we fit into this cooperative, the school? You kind of understand the umbrella of things that we do here in the school, of how that really ties into your cooperative.
[B.297] Interviewee: And then, I guess, when you… on the need, though.
[B.298] Interviewee: On the question of needs, what we need, we are…
[B.299] Interviewee: You heard our story of how we told that we're able to produce this, we're able to help our children become healthier, help our community become healthier, we're sharing it with the community, but at the end of the day, we're losing so much of the produce, and
[B.300] Interviewee: vegetables to just not having that avenue of distributing it. Processing it, and canning it.
[B.301] Interviewee: you know, those types of things, storing it for long terms. We're really trying to stretch our growing seasons, as far as through greenhouses and high tunnels, to… instead of having that 90-day Location_1 winter or summer growing season, we're able to 6, 7, 8 months through greenhouses.
[B.302] Interviewee: So, we're always looking for those types of initiatives and those types of avenues to expand our garden.
[B.303] Interviewee: Then the other part is the processing part. We, as a school, as an administration, as a team, we've decided that that was one of the biggest things that was holding us up, was the processing part of this. We grew 3 acres of corn this year. We were able to successfully process
[B.304] Interviewee: Probably, traditionally processed, probably 600 to 700 each?
[B.305] Interviewee: quarts of corn, we sell that at [Financial_Amount] a quart, so [Financial_Amount] is, you know, whatever that works out to be, [Financial_Amount] right there.
[B.306] Interviewee: With… but… out of that 3 acres of corn that we processed, only…
[B.307] Interviewee: I would say less than a quarter of that, maybe a fifth of the corn was able to be harvested and processed. The rest was left, and it got to that point where it was too dry past that stage of processing, which we could have made in excess of [Financial_Amount] worth of
[B.308] Interviewee: you know, like Ricardo said, we're potentially going to be 21 acres next year. If we're able to really secure that… that means of
[B.309] Interviewee: processing and, you know, doing those types of things. We're able to provide a workforce
[B.310] Interviewee: income coming back into this community through our children, and some of the… we have a group of children that are life… they're called Organization_5. Their program is Organization_5. They're, more,
[B.311] Interviewee: at-need children, the ones that have, physical, limitations, I guess, that they work in this, but they're, they're probably our best workers out of the 50-plus kids that come through this program every year. They're probably our best workers, but in the normal day-to-day, of this, this
[B.312] Interviewee: world, they're not going to be able to go to Sioux City, or they're not going to be able to go to a different community, or even within the community, the jobs that are available for them are very limited. But they would be successful in this… in this setting, because they understand it, and they've grown into it through it.
[B.313] Interviewee: So we, as the school, we've… we've…
[B.314] Interviewee: you've seen our facility, Person_5. We've,
[B.315] Interviewee: We have… we work with a special group of designers and architects
[B.316] Interviewee: they were able to put some numbers together to build a processing center where we could do that, and then that processing center would actually be an extension of our career academy. It would have a classroom and a lab, which, in turn, be able to process Location_7 these produces and foods through
[B.317] Interviewee: and put it… be able to make it shelf-ready, shelf-stable, to be able to take to the stores, the C-Store, Organization_31, the local Hy-Vee, Location_7 those types of things.
[B.318] Interviewee: But it's just getting to that point right now with the government funding, cuts, with Location_7 those, I guess, those avenues that were available before through USDA, you know, Organization_1, different, different government
[B.319] Interviewee: grant opportunities, and the things that you could say in a grant, we're really limited now on funding sources, so we've been going after a lot of, what do you call.
[B.320] Interviewee: Fucker, so…
[B.321] Interviewee: not grants anymore, more just the private fundings, foundations, those types. We've been trying to tailor our funding, but everybody in the country is doing that right now, so we're really limited on those sources, and we fall through the gap through a lot of grants as being a public school on a reservation.
[B.322] Interviewee: We're not a non-profit. We're still… we're still a public school like any other school in the state of Location_1, so people see us on the reservation, they send these grants to us, apply for this grant.
[B.323] Interviewee: And, you know, oh, you're a tribal entity, you're this, you're… we're really a state
[B.324] Interviewee: run facility on a reservation. So we get Location_7 the way through, do Location_7 the writing, our whole team does Location_7 the resources, put Location_7 the effort into it, then it comes up at the end, we're not even eligible for that. So we run into Location_7 those things with this process, etc.
[B.325] Interviewee: So that's one of our bigger things, and one of my personal goals is anybody that has any ties to universities, or any,
[B.326] Interviewee: future higher education and, technology, or whatever it is that if it fits in that realm of agriculture, of what we're doing, our kids identify as
[B.327] Interviewee: kids of North Location_17, of South Chicago, of the Location_8, of different… that's how our kids identify, but the truth is that we are in
[B.328] Interviewee: right in the middle of farm country. The majority of our jobs and their future is in agriculture, if they want to make a sustainable living close to home. So if we're able to,
[B.329] Interviewee: every time a university comes here, I ask them, offer one of our students an ag degree, whether it's in veterinarian, whether it's horticulture, whether it's, you know.
[B.330] Interviewee: livestock management, whatever it is, you know, I'll make that available to one of our students. So, in turn, the tribe, Organization_37 itself has a
[B.331] Interviewee: Organization_12 farms that they operate, they… 20, 30, 50,000 acres of land that they have the ability to farm themselves. If we're able to
[B.332] Interviewee: to follow these kids and shadow them through after high school, through college, through these degrees, that in turn, maybe one day, somebody's going to go through a farm management program at Organization_45. They're going to be able to come back and run that farm. Somebody's going to go be the livestock manager. We're able to grow cattle, hogs.
[B.333] Interviewee: Chicken.
[B.334] Interviewee: you know, Location_7 those things, the veterinarian that goes along with that, carpenter that needs to build Location_7 those things, so building economic development through that. So, that was, you know, that personally, that's a goal of mine, that I want to see these kids
[B.335] Interviewee: Be able to do that goal, then take our concept idea of this sustainable living, this organic style growing, traditional food sustainability, take that idea, that mindset.
[B.336] Interviewee: that we're teaching them, get their higher education and bring them ideas, come back at a corporate level, I guess, would say, corporate farm operation, and be able to run a
[B.337] Interviewee: Ag farm that's full circle, not just corn or not just cow.

Page 16

[B.338] Interviewee: I guess that's… My need and my… my vision for… Our students.
[B.339] Interviewee: That's right.
[A.89] Interviewer: That's, you know, so important, and it's really powerful that, you know, that that's the vision, you know, that it continues on for… you know, you want our young people
[A.90] Interviewer: to really, you know, carry this work forward. And I can see that with, this research project as well. Like, I want to, I want to see these students thrive with this knowledge, and to really.
[A.91] Interviewer: take it to the… to the next part, to be full-on researchers and make that happen. And… oh, I'm sorry, Person_5, I didn't mean to…
[A.92] Interviewer: To talk over you if you were going to say something else.
[E.76] Interviewee: Oh, oh, you.
[A.93] Interviewer: Okay.
[A.94] Interviewer: But that was pretty much it. I wanted to be respectful of your time as well, but were there other things that you wanted to share before we close out?
[B.340] Interviewee: Just anytime you guys want to… you're in the neighborhood, in the area, you want to see what we're doing here, stop by, get ahold of Ricardo and I, we'll be willing to give you a tour, visit with you, and show you what we're doing down here. And I always want to be part of what's going on in our community, so Barry, reach out.
[B.341] Interviewee: And let us know what's going on, how we can fit in. Sam, really kind of interested in looking at what you put together for us, and how we do, and I'd like to be in contact with you in the future.
[D.49] Interviewee: Absolutely, absolutely. I love the garden, too. Ricardo took me through it last time I was in town. Really impressive, very cool.
[E.77] Interviewee: Thank you. Ricardo, I'm gonna… and… and Person_2, I want to connect you guys to the Getagone, program at Organization_9 of Location_5.
[E.78] Interviewee: They have a commercial kitchen, because when I went in there, I went, oh my gosh, this looks like what I saw at Location_17.
[E.79] Interviewee: But they have a… they've bought a freeze dryer.
[E.80] Interviewee: And a flash freezer that they have there in the facility.
[E.81] Interviewee: And, there was another woman, at,
[E.82] Interviewee: Cheyenne River, they pulled their money together, and they bought a real high-end freeze dryer. And the women, the community from their gardens, they did something like 2 or 3 tons of food that would have been left on the ground in the community, and they put it in a freeze dryer.
[E.83] Interviewee: And the food then, you know, you put it in jars.
[E.84] Interviewee: And, with a tight seal, and that food is… really lasts indefinitely. And it's a quick way to process, but also the flash freezing, too, is really good.
[E.85] Interviewee: You know, so there's some resources I'll send to you guys in about a week.
[E.86] Interviewee: And I have a lot of things for grants and other programs, but there's other co-ops that are doing some work that you guys are doing. Get a Gone is a tribal program.
[E.87] Interviewee: But the Tohonah Odom.
[E.88] Interviewee: They have… they have a farm, and they're growing corn, squash, and Location_7 their traditional foods that they redistribute to their elders in the community, but they've also created value-added food products from their gardens, and that's where the kids get involved, you know, to create…
[E.89] Interviewee: Foods that they can market, and sell, and learn how to can, and…
[E.90] Interviewee: Some of those things are not real expensive to get into.
[E.91] Interviewee: You know, even some of the big, the way that they can… you can can, like, 50, 60 quarts at a time, so…
[B.342] Interviewee: Person_5, thank you. I have 15 students showing up in.
[E.92] Interviewee: I'll let you… yes, well, I'm gonna get you guys some information, okay?
[B.343] Interviewee: I put my name in the message, my email is in the message, chat message, so you could use that.
[B.344] Interviewee: But again, thank you, everybody, for Location_7 your time and your support, and we look forward to being in contact.
[A.95] Interviewer: Absolutely.
[E.93] Interviewee: Thank you so much for your…
[A.96] Interviewer: taking the time… oh, sorry, Person_5.
[E.94] Interviewee: You guys should…
[C.199] Interviewer: tortured.
[B.345] Interviewee: Yep.
[E.95] Interviewee: I just need to get you guys' address, because we want to be able to send a thank you gift to you for your time today.
[B.346] Interviewee: Correct.
[E.96] Interviewee: So, Person_3, we're putting you in charge of getting everybody's addresses for us.
[C.200] Interviewer: Location_7 right, Location_7 right. Hey, I got one last thought, too. I got one last thought, Person_1.
[B.347] Interviewee: Don't.
[C.201] Interviewer: You know,
[C.202] Interviewer: some of this work, I want to go back to some of the… the initiative we started, and… and the way I see it, again, I…
[C.203] Interviewer: You know, as a strategy, you know, a business strategy, that's how I look at it.
[C.204] Interviewer: And… and so what we're trying to do is we're trying to, again, create this pathway that isn't there
[C.205] Interviewer: but for the leadership, meaning our tribal council, because, you know, I'm kind of got… I'm bottlenecked if Pamela gives me Location_7 this great training, but then there's no pathway. You know, there's not even anybody to talk to.
[C.206] Interviewer: So, I hope you're understanding, Person_5, our struggle.
[C.207] Interviewer: And so, again, it was important to bring this team aboard, and that included Sam. I'm not trying to toot his horn, but it was important for us to make the case, you know, to our… to our leadership, because really.
[C.208] Interviewer: nobody knew where to start. And so, again, I want to highlight that this is our effort, and… and again, it's important that, as Rich was talking, and I'm sorry he had to… well, he had to leave, but… but it…

Page 17

[C.209] Interviewer: how are we going to create that pathway if there's none, you know? And if we want kids to come home, to what? Get educated, then come home and say, well.
[C.210] Interviewer: where do I start? Since we've started, I've had our… our non-native bank say, Person_3, you know, we'll support some of your cooperative participants.
[C.211] Interviewer: if they meet their quota, whatever that is with you. So, we have… we are starting to build, again, those relationships with banks. There's a CDFI in Location_13 that we've been…
[C.212] Interviewer: We've been aware of, or been alerted of, so there's things that are starting to open up.
[C.213] Interviewer: And again, as you see us make this case, we hope that someday, Here soon that… that…
[C.214] Interviewer: Location_7 those entrepreneurs and cooperative people will say, man, I got some money, and here's where I'm going. I'm going to our office of whatever.
[C.215] Interviewer: So, I hope I was clear about that message and our initiative, what we're trying to do. And again, you know, like any good manager.
[C.216] Interviewer: We had the strategy, then I needed the team.
[C.217] Interviewer: Right? And I'll leave the last comment to Sam. Sam, I want to thank you for being here. Thank you, Person_5 and Person_1, for having me. I hope I helped. Go ahead, Person_4, you're on, buddy.
[D.50] Interviewee: Just, thank you.
[D.51] Interviewee: Okay, it's Friday. Thank you very much. It's, it's, it's an honor to be here, and to be on the journey with you, Person_3, so thanks for asking me.
[C.218] Interviewer: You bet.
[D.52] Interviewee: And thank you, Person_1 and Person_5, very much for the time, and it was great to reconnect with you, and your work is really fascinating, and important, as, you know, and it's great. Thank you.
[E.97] Interviewee: Well, thank you for the work that you do. So…
[E.98] Interviewee: Yes, and Person_3, I'll give you a call, and we can talk some more, because one of the things that I'm going to be doing is hiring people.
[E.99] Interviewee: To present, and maybe we need to have,
[E.100] Interviewee: A section on how do you approach your tribal leadership to get engagement?
[E.101] Interviewee: And what are the steps that we need to take? Who are the people you need to bring to the table?
[C.219] Interviewer: to get them to stand behind you, so thank you for bringing… because I hadn't thought of that, so thank you for bringing that up. That's really critical.
[E.102] Interviewee: That's why we need each other, because we Location_7 bring a different piece of the picture.
[E.103] Interviewee: To this, you know, to this work. It's so important.
[C.220] Interviewer: You bet, you bet. Pamela, I have to run.
[E.104] Interviewee: I know.
[C.221] Interviewer: Oh, you told me not to do it?
[C.222] Interviewer: I know. How can I do it?
[E.105] Interviewee: I'm just… I know I'm just bossy. You can't… you gotta listen. I'm older than you.
[C.223] Interviewer: Well, Person_5, can I do it for Jodi? You know what I'm talking about.
[E.106] Interviewee: Well, no, you can't, and you're not gonna do that to her. Yeah, please.
[B.348] Interviewee: Alright, brother-in-law.
[C.224] Interviewer: Huh?
[B.349] Interviewee: Go ahead, brother-in-law.
[C.225] Interviewer: Person_5, are you sure now? Because you won't talk to me for 2 years again.
[D.53] Interviewee: Oh, you just go ahead, Person_3, you're just gonna be your bad old self.
[C.226] Interviewer: Location_7 right, I'll listen to you, family, you're ordering me. Alright, yes. Hey, thank you guys, Person_4, Person_1.
[D.54] Interviewee: Thank you. Hello, Rich!
[D.55] Interviewee: Thank you Location_7.
[E.107] Interviewee: Thank you Location_7.
[D.56] Interviewee: We'll talk to the two of you again soon.
[E.108] Interviewee: Yes. Jodi, do you want to just talk for a minute after we're done, or did I interrupt you? I didn't mean to interrupt you.
[A.97] Interviewer: No, that's completely fine. We got what we, you know, wanted to learn from, and so this is great.
[E.109] Interviewee: Okay, okay, alright.
[D.57] Interviewee: Thank you.
[E.110] Interviewee: Thank you! Have a great weekend, you guys!
[B.350] Interviewee: You as well. Take care.
[E.111] Interviewee: Thank you. Bye-bye.
[A.98] Interviewer: Wonderful, let me stop the recording.
[A.99] Interviewer: I'm sorry, I…
