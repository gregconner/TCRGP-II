The Coalition to Stop Violence Against Native Women
[A.1] Interviewer: 8/4/[Year]
Interviewee – Person_3
[B.1] Interviewee: Wonderful. Well, good afternoon. My name is Person_2.
[B.2] Interviewee: Do you have any additional questions about this? This project that we're that we're talking about before we start the interview.
Person_3 | CSVANW: I don't think I have any questions right now.
[B.3] Interviewee: Wonderful. Okay, if you, if you do have questions at any point, let me know I'm completely open to to answering those and helping as much as I can.
[B.4] Interviewee: So the 1st one, what is your role and your your position in the organization.
Person_3 | CSVANW: So, as I mentioned, my current role is training and education director with the coalition to stop violence against native women. And I'm I'm also stepping in for Tiffany, her own as the acting executive director of the Coalition, as well.
[B.5] Interviewee: Awesome.
[B.6] Interviewee: Where is your where? Where is your organization located, and what it was the purpose of the or of the organization.
Person_3 | CSVANW: So we are located centrally in Location_4, Location_3. That is where our office is located. However, our service area, the population that we serve is all of Location_3, part of Location_1, part of Location_7, the Organization_4 in El Paso. I'm sorry in Location_15, and also
Person_3 | CSVANW: where am I missing? Oh, tiny bit of Location_6. So basically, we cover all the tribes in Location_3. We cover the Navajo nation as well. The Apache tribes and part of those tribes in Location_7.
Person_3 | CSVANW: and we really try to just service the tribes in the Location_14 region. Our focus, of course, is Location_3, but we are all over the place. As far as location in Location_3 we have staff that are located also in different parts of Location_3, so even though our office is centrally located in Location_4. We are remote employees, and so that allows us to branch out, and when we hire
Person_3 | CSVANW: and hire folks from different communities and from different backgrounds. So that way, we have a really diverse group of individuals that can support our community needs where they where they arise.
[B.7] Interviewee: Wonderful. That's really important to think about all the different things that you do and like where you're you're located.
[B.8] Interviewee: So what brought the community together to start the organization like what was part of the original vision.
Person_3 | CSVANW: Yeah, our original vision is still our vision. Today, our mission and vision is healthy families, healthy communities.
Person_3 | CSVANW: And I know you also asked for our the purpose of our organization, and I totally skipped over that. So I'd like to readdress that as well. Our purpose is to provide advocacy to provide community resources. And to, I think, one of the things we value the most is meeting community where they're at. And so our, of course, our our vision is healthy families, healthy communities.
Person_3 | CSVANW: with the intention in mind of providing resources for domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. But also what does prevention look like for our tribal communities and preventing those things from happening. For the longest time we have been focused on intervention, practices, and training our advocates and training our service providers of how to engage with survivors who may come from tribal communities
Person_3 | CSVANW: and may have different backgrounds from them, and also training our our tribal community advocates about confidentiality, because we understand that that is a huge issue in tribal communities about, you know, how are we building trust with one another when confidentiality is continuously broken. Right? We have a lot of cases where we hear about things slipping
Person_3 | CSVANW: from the system and getting back to community. And so we want to avoid that from happening and continue to build trust when we're working with survivors who've experienced these types of violences. And so our goals that we've had from from 30 years ago have remained the same that we want to.
Person_3 | CSVANW: you know, build healthy families and healthy communities. And by building that we're talking about, how are we interacting with survivors? Where are our resources? Where are our gaps? Where are the barriers? And how are we responding to those those different things? So you can also, of course, find our mission vision and our objectives on our website and on our about us page. And it explains all of these things, but those are the things I would like to highlight.
[B.9] Interviewee: Absolutely. That's wonderful. Thank you, Person_3.
[B.10] Interviewee: So some indigenous communities use these cooperatives or these organizations to reinforce traditional systems
[B.11] Interviewee: and values. Is that something. Is that the case here?
Person_3 | CSVANW: Yes, absolutely. So we you can find our values on our website as well. And I want to pull them up for myself. Just so I can remember and get all of them in there. But we that is
Person_3 | CSVANW: absolutely something that we carry and all that we do so. Our values include culture.
Person_3 | CSVANW: kinship, innovation, healing, and inclusiveness.
Person_3 | CSVANW: And the reason why we hold those values is to remember and remind ourselves in all that we do that we want to incorporate our
Person_3 | CSVANW: holistic practices from all of the tribal communities that are a part of our work. Right? So we are not, you know, we don't just carry practices from one community, but we think about what are things in the Location_12 that work for the Location_12 that we want to continue to carry in our work all of those cultural practices, all of that knowledge that is near and dear to those Location_12 that they're, you know, willing to share. Of course
Person_3 | CSVANW: we want to continue to incorporate those into our work, and likewise with our Apache tribes, with our Navajo tribes, when we're talking to advocates about, how do we support survivors?
Person_3 | CSVANW: We want to ensure that we're educating them with a holistic approach, right? And so in our trainings and in our events that we host. We always try to incorporate things that are not, you know, like a standard training view, we try to provide smudging. We try to provide opportunities for healing in different ways. And so we incorporate all of those indigenous practices into our
Person_3 | CSVANW: in our trainings, to keep those alive, and to show that those things are important, especially language, too. You know, language is something that I think all of our
Person_3 | CSVANW: tribes are struggling to keep alive, and I think there has been a movement to bring more awareness to language, and that's been really great. And so we want to tune into that. And we want to continue to incorporate different languages. And how are we? How are we being accessible to survivors who may only speak Navajo, or who may, who may only speak their Location_13 language. We want to make sure that we are incorporating all of those practices
Person_3 | CSVANW: and finding interpreters or finding ways that we can use technology to support with language access. And so we keep in mind all of those things, and our values is what helps us to remember that that is a part of
Person_3 | CSVANW: who we are now. 30 years later those values that were created were created 30 years ago, when 3 indigenous women from different tribes came together and decided that there are no resources for for indigenous women as far as combating domestic violence. And so they wanted to create an organization that would provide resource that would provide a space where people can go and call
Person_3 | CSVANW: and ask. You know, I'm in this situation, and I need a lawyer, or I'm in this situation, and I need housing, and so we would be the ones who would direct them to find those resources for them, and also to share those needs with our legislative groups of this is what's missing in our communities. And this is what we need to advocate for. And so now, 30 years later, we are. We are now that organization. We have 18 staff, and we carry all of these different important things into our work.
[B.12] Interviewee: That's wonderful. That's so powerful. That's really important that you're doing this type of work. And you're looking at these different needs that are in the communities, and you're responding to them. It's great. It's really important.
Person_3 | CSVANW: Thank you.
[B.13] Interviewee: Absolutely so as part of that like, how did how did you like? How did this cooperative like? How did people learn about this like if they're if they have needs. You know that you're definitely addressing. How do they find out about this.
Person_3 | CSVANW: About our organization.
[B.14] Interviewee: Yes.
Person_3 | CSVANW: So. That's a really great question. We.
Person_3 | CSVANW: I think, number one, because we've been around for 30 years. I think word of mouth has definitely
Person_3 | CSVANW: been a huge factor of how folks know us. But I also want to recognize that our Organization_1 has done a really fantabulous that's not even a word, but a fantastic job at our social media, our campaigns, and have have worked, you know, just
Person_3 | CSVANW: countless hours to promote our membership and to promote our organization. And we have a very high
Person_3 | CSVANW: social media following. I believe we have 10,000 followers on social media, and we also have a lot of subscribers to our newsletters, and that is because of all of the outreach that we've done online and tapping into social media. And then you know, this new age of sharing. You know our our existence right with the world has definitely improved our
Person_3 | CSVANW: our organizational or our organization's awareness and community.
Person_3 | CSVANW: And so I definitely would say that they're probably the biggest factor of how folks know us. And when you type, when you type in, you know, violence against native women or domestic violence resources for native women. Or you know, any kind of combination of those words into Google, our organization is one of the 1st ones that will come up. And so that is definitely how folks also know us as well as just through Google search. And I would say, we get about.

Page 2

Person_3 | CSVANW: I'd say probably 5 to 10. Resource calls a week
Person_3 | CSVANW: from domestic violence, survivors or sexual violence survivors who call us asking for immediate resources, and we are the ones who help them to get connected to the right source. And that is partly because they they look up those keywords on Google. And our organization is one of the 1st things that comes up. I think also, our advocates know us because we host advocate meetings every month.
Person_3 | CSVANW: and we get them connected, and they know that we are the source that people can go to if maybe they don't have the resources that somebody's coming to them, for they redirect them to us, and so we then carry on that person and help them find what they're looking for. So I think a combination of all of those different things have really built our capacity here.
Person_2, wow! That's really important. Thank you for sharing that.
[B.15] Interviewee: Did your cooperative adapt or adopt standard cooperative development approaches to meet your needs.
Person_3 | CSVANW: Did we add.
[B.16] Interviewee: Oh, I'm sorry, or to meet the needs of the community that that you were that you were seeing like, did you? Did you shape your organization to meet the needs of the community? Or did you see that the needs of the community weren't being met by your organization?
Person_3 | CSVANW: Oh, that's a really great question. I believe that what we do is
Person_3 | CSVANW: constantly innovative, based off of community needs. And I I think that our mission and our vision and our values allow us to.
Person_3 | CSVANW: you know, to shift as community shifts, you know. Like, for example, Location_9, right was a huge.
Person_3 | CSVANW: a huge
Person_3 | CSVANW: pandemic that affect everybody's lives right? And I think one of the things that came from Location_9 was that we all shifted online. You know, we, our meetings were online, our everybody was getting information from social media and from websites and
Person_3 | CSVANW: webinars. And so we also shifted right? We couldn't do events in person. And so we were meeting communities needs where they were. Because we, you know, started hosting webinars. We started moving our trainings online. And I think that's a good example of how we pivoted with community, but also
Person_3 | CSVANW: needs change. Right? Like a lot of shelters have opened up. And of course there are. There is still a huge need for for housing in Location_3, but we are excited to see how things have shifted, and how there have been more resources available like 30 years ago. There was nothing right. There was no resources for women there were. There was nowhere to go 30 years ago, and now there are a lot of resources available
Person_3 | CSVANW: available for survivors to tap into. We are still lacking resources in tribal communities specifically. But it's really great to see. You know how things have changed. And so we need to evolve, based off of okay, what is the next need? And how can our organization help to fulfill that need. And I believe that you know our vision and our mission helps us to pivot because of that. And so
Person_3 | CSVANW: yeah, that's just a couple of examples. But we definitely are community oriented. Everything that we do. We pull feedback from
Person_3 | CSVANW: all of our events, always have an evaluation form. We've even hosted focus groups and other talking circles to inform our organization of how how we are responding. And maybe there's something in community that we're lacking. And so we try to be led by our community. And another way that we do that is also through our membership.
Person_3 | CSVANW: We are membership driven because we are a nonprofit. We get grant funding. But a lot of our support also comes through our members, and during our quarter membership meetings we talk to our members about how they can be involved and also get feedback from our members of
Person_3 | CSVANW: you know, maybe there's there's things that we can tap into, or maybe there are things that we need to pivot or shift, and we we highly value that feedback from our members as well. And so they help us to Co. Lead the organization. It's not just our leaders. It's not just our staff that are leading, but it's our community and our members who are helping us lead the work that we're doing.
[B.17] Interviewee: Wow! That's really important. And wow, thank you for sharing that, Person_3. Because I was, I was wondering like, how do they? How do they do this because they always seem to like the coalition is always like up to date and thinking about these different things, like as they're moving and changing with like, you know how things are happening within [Year],
[B.18] Interviewee: which leads to my next question about like, How do you keep tribal leaders engaged in like the work that you're doing, especially given the fact that, like
[B.19] Interviewee: in some Location_12, you know, like the our governors change, you know, like
[B.20] Interviewee: every year, like every 2 years, it just varies. So how do? How does the coalition work with that.
Person_3 | CSVANW: Yeah, that's a great question. And I think to your point, it changes all the time. You know the way that we're collaborating with tribal leadership. Changes over time. And
Person_3 | CSVANW: I think you know the biggest things that we do. Number one is community relationships. A lot of our staff have been involved in their own Location_12 and communities in many different shapes and forms, and so most of them know their tribal leaders right, with with the exception of Navajo nation, because they're so large, right? And it's really hard to get a hold of some of their delegates and
Person_3 | CSVANW: and like the President, for example. But but our community members are very engaged within their own communities, and so number one would be community connections. Some of our staff are like, Oh, I know my tribal leader. I can go send a message to them. They can get involved right? And so we have that advantage for sure. The second thing is, we have a policy and advocacy team
Person_3 | CSVANW: that was formed about 2 years ago now, and our policy and Advocacy department leads those communications for the organization and what that means is we are sending letters to them frequently
Person_3 | CSVANW: we are calling them frequently we are getting them engaged and ready for a tribal consultation that comes up. And that's a really huge thing that that helps us build rapport and helps us build that community support with tribal leaders is tribal consultation that happens every year in October, and that's a huge opportunity for us to get involved with them and support them in writing. And you know whatever they need for tribal consultation. We're there to help support them.
Person_3 | CSVANW: And so we also have flown tribal leadership out to tribal consultation on our own expense to get them there, and to support them in that capacity as well. And I think a couple years ago we sent 3 tribal leaders to Location_11 to join tribal consultation, and we were sitting right there next to them, supporting them and what they needed for tribal consultation. And so that's what you know. One thing that we've done, and we've done that every year.
Person_3 | CSVANW: And
Person_3 | CSVANW: we stay we stay in communication with them because of those opportunities. I think another thing as well is we host a pretty large conference every year called Organization_3, and that conference usually is we usually host around 250 people.
Person_3 | CSVANW: and
Person_3 | CSVANW: it's, you know, exclusively for tribal leadership, for advocates and for their, you know, their staff and also community members and community partners. You know, that are involved in the work as well, so that major conflict conference brings together tribal leadership from all different you know tribes, and
Person_3 | CSVANW: to engage in the same conversation about what are we doing to combat violence against native women? Where are we at right now? Where are we moving, moving forward? You know what is our what is our collective goal?
Person_3 | CSVANW: And also what are the gaps and what are the realities, too? Right like what? What tribes and Location_12 are doing things a lot more advanced than other tribes and Location_12. How can we learn from each other? For example, like Pawauke, they have an incredible
Person_3 | CSVANW: team out there just in every department, right? Their advocates are very responsive. Their law enforcement is doing multiple things that are.
Person_3 | CSVANW: I would say, even advance in the State in in supporting, missing, and murdered indigenous women's crisis. They have a lot of tools that they've adapted that other tribes and Location_12 can learn from, and they the one thing I love about Location_5 is that they're also very responsive to
Person_3 | CSVANW: being there to train and being there to help other tribes to know. Like, you know, this is what's working for us, and I think you all can do it, too, you know, and that's the kind of collaboration that we are desperately needing in other communities. And so Location_10 has collaborated with us on multiple different projects to train tribal judges to train law enforcement, to train anybody that is involved in that system
Person_3 | CSVANW: to adopt these practices, or even, you know. See what what can work for them right in supporting this crisis that we're having here in Location_3 for our missing and murdered indigenous women and children
Person_3 | CSVANW: and meant and so that's that's another way that we stay up to date with tribal leadership and our policy and advocacy team. They go and visit the tribal offices, and they try to get on the agenda for tribal council and present these different things that we different ways, that we can collaborate with them to tribal leaders. And that's 1 of the way that we've all one of the ways that we have also continued that partnership and healthy relationships with them.
[B.21] Interviewee: Wow! That's really important. That's powerful. Thank you for sharing that. Yes, it's really important. When these different Location_12 can, especially with like that, the Location_13 can like show like this is what is working, you know, for us. And this is how this is how we're doing and being transparent about that. And it's really important for people in like learning.
Person_3 | CSVANW: Actually.
[B.22] Interviewee: That's really good.
[B.23] Interviewee: Do you feel like there's other organizations that do some of the work that's similar to like what the Coalition does, or do you feel like? The Coalition works? Not not stand alone because you've definitely talked about the ways that you that you collaborate yet in thinking about? Is there another organization here, within, like anywhere in like the Location_14, that does the type of work that the coalition does.
Person_3 | CSVANW: Yeah. So that's a really great question. And I'd like to think about that. I think a little bit. But you know there are a couple other coalitions here in Location_3 that do similar work that we do. For example, the Location_3 domestic violence
Person_3 | CSVANW: coalition. That's a statewide coalition as well, and they do. You know, their work is focused mostly on domestic violence. However, they're not specific for tribal communities. They just service the whole state. For you know, those different types of similar like ta training and advocacy and legislative efforts. And then, similarly, the Location_3 coalition of sexual assault programs.
Person_3 | CSVANW: They also, they're similar to the domestic violence coalition, except for their sexual violence, but for the whole State. So those 2 organizations, or also coalitions, do similar work that we do. But they're not focused specifically on our tribal communities. And really, I think the partnership that we've had with those 2 coalitions is they reach out to us when they feel like, you know, they don't have the capacity to.
Person_3 | CSVANW: you know, support with a certain request, or if they have a client, or if they have somebody that comes comes to them asking for something. That's
Person_3 | CSVANW: that's, you know, related to one of our tribal communities. They will ask us for the expertise to carry on that request. So we've partnered with them on multiple projects which I highly respect and honor that they reach out to us for support in that way, and we're able to, you know. Continue that open door of collaboration with our other coalitions here in Location_3.
Person_3 | CSVANW: and likewise in Location_1, is one of our sister coalitions. So I'm sure you are, and the students may be aware that we are a part of many coalitions throughout the United Location_8, and there are coalitions. I believe there's I don't want to misspeak, but I believe there's 23 of us, if I can remember. And I know that there's actually one that's coming up

Page 3

Person_3 | CSVANW: as well, that they're starting a coalition. I can't remember exactly what state it is in, but very excited about another coalition happening in the United Location_8. But we have many, many coalitions that do work just similarly to out to us, and the closest one that would be in the Location_14 region would be in Location_1. It's the Location_14, indigenous women's coalition really, really wonderful
Person_3 | CSVANW: staff, and does very similar work that we do. But their their focus is in Location_1 and and their surrounding. I'm not sure exactly our service area, but I know it's mostly Location_1, so we collaborate with them often as well, and support each other in the work
Person_3 | CSVANW: as well as our other sister coalitions throughout the United Location_8. We meet every Tuesday as far as Organization_2. They all meet every Tuesday for about 2 h, and we talk about how we can continue to support each other in this work. I think one of the really helpful things is we talk about funding we talk about, you know, when we're having issues with maybe staff or our board of directors. Or if we're having issues with the State, you know
Person_3 | CSVANW: different types of issues that we can soundboard each other with and get different opinions. Because I think.
Person_3 | CSVANW: you know, that's really important in the work that we do is there might be other tribes in other Location_8 who are doing things differently, and we can learn from that, too, right? Just like how pewake like they're doing things differently. And they found what works for them. And so we're kind of doing that similar thing with other tribal coalitions of sharing that knowledge. You know, knowledge sharing is really important for tribal communities. And so we're trying to keep that alive
Person_3 | CSVANW: by joining together with other tribal coalitions. And, you know, realigning ourselves with what's what's the immediate needs right now in the United Location_8 and in our Location_8. And how are we supporting one another? And so those, you know, those are the different ways that we
Person_3 | CSVANW: are collaborative with other organizations that are similar to us. But I also want to recognize that in in most of the spaces that we enter, a lot of folks think that we're a national coalition.
Person_3 | CSVANW: which is, you know, it's it's really it's an honor, you know, to be seen at that capacity. We are not a national coalition right? That would be the there is a national coalition which would be the
Person_3 | CSVANW: National!
Person_3 | CSVANW: Oh, my goodness, I'm forgetting their Niwrc national, Organization_6.
Person_3 | CSVANW: So they are our, you know, national resource for our coalitions, but you know we are one of the largest coalitions. I believe we are the largest coalition in the United Location_8. And so, you know, we have a very high capacity, and a lot of people are shocked at how much work we do. But we are. We are blessed to be doing the work that we're doing because of the funding opportunities we have received because of our staff, who are very passionate and strong, willed and ready to do the work.
Person_3 | CSVANW: And so, you know, we we do carry a lot, and our staff carry a lot, and you know I'm going to be very transparent as well. That some of these challenges that we come up against are, you know, are real right as far as like there are some tribal leaders that we haven't got in contact with. Right? Like there are.
Person_3 | CSVANW: There's still resistance in tribal communities. There are still many barriers that we're facing for resources and for even just connection, you know, with different communities. And so, you know, there are challenges that we come up against. But I think
Person_3 | CSVANW: the support that we have with other coalitions and with other organizations in Location_3. Who do you know? Similar work as us has been very helpful in feeling like, we're not alone right in this work. And I think that's really important, too.
[B.24] Interviewee: Absolutely. That's really important. Thank you for sharing that.
[B.25] Interviewee: You know, as part of that you had mentioned previously. Your as you pivot as you're working with these different organizations about your how you utilize social media. Did that help you develop a marketing, I guess, plan or like how you wanted to utilize
[B.26] Interviewee: different types of, you know, like maybe not always talking to people, one on one, but definitely utilizing social media, or whoever you chose to do that.
Person_3 | CSVANW: Yeah, I definitely think that social media has played a huge role in that as well. I think that's actually one of the reasons why people think we're a national organization because our social media presence is is, you know, is not just, you know, doesn't just reach Organization_5. But we engage with tribes across, you know, all different
Person_3 | CSVANW: areas, not even in the United Location_8, but across the world like globally right? And we've we've got. And we've actually collaborated with a global organization recently, where we actually connected with another tribe. I believe they were. Oh, my goodness! Oh, in Location_2.
Person_3 | CSVANW: I don't want to misspeak which tribe we connected with, but you know, in another country we we connected with them, and they actually came and flew to the United Location_8 and visited our office and asked us questions about the work that we're doing and how we're doing the work and how we're doing it different than than they're doing it right. And the whole purpose of the meeting was exactly what I'm talking about here is
Person_3 | CSVANW: they want to know, you know from other places of the world. What are you doing to combat violence? And how can we pull from your indigenous knowledge systems for our indigenous knowledge systems to, you know, collaborate across the globe, you know, to combat violence against against our women, children, and men. And
Person_3 | CSVANW: and that was, you know, that was so enlightening. And and what an amazing experience that we got to collaborate with another tribe from, you know another part of the world, and and just talk right. Just have conversation and share stories. And
Person_3 | CSVANW: and that came from social media. You know just them seeing us in our presence online and wanting to be involved in reaching out to us on our website. And so, yeah, I would definitely say that that you know, social media has opened a lot of doors for us.
[B.27] Interviewee: Absolutely. That's that's really important.
[B.28] Interviewee: you know, especially as you think about. And you mentioned previously, with like your approaches to Location_9, as like everybody had to like pivot and shift, and I remember, like so many of of our classrooms, had to like, shut down completely, and then, like leave the buildings when I was because I was over at Sippy when that when that happened in March of [Year] No.
[B.29] Interviewee: [Year]. And it was just it's just wild, you know, because you're thinking like, Wow, are, we're in the midst of this global pandemic. And so, you know, like, how did how did the Coalition work with that? I mean because you mentioned pivoting?
[B.30] Interviewee: But how did the Coalition work with that.
Person_3 | CSVANW: Yeah, that's a good question.
Person_3 | CSVANW: we pivoted in a lot of ways, I think, like everybody else, right? Like, you know, all all schools, colleges, elementary schools, high schools, like all pivoted right during that time, and and you know likewise our coalitions also pivoted. Of course I mentioned before that we moved all of our events virtually.
Person_3 | CSVANW: and before I also get into all of the content about Location_9, I was not a staff member when Location_9 hit at the Coalition. I was still in Location_1, doing prevention work at a different organization. So I know you know globally how we all pivoted. But I do know some information about how we pivoted and how we continue to support community. That's also what I'm going to provide. So I just want to give a little bit context that I'm not speaking from my own personal experience here at the organization, but what I've heard from Staff during that period.
Person_3 | CSVANW: And so we moved all of our events virtual. So we still hosted trainings. We still hosted webinars. Every year we host our 40 40 h advocate certification trainings for tribal communities.
Person_3 | CSVANW: And all of that material moved online. And I'm not sure of the outcome or or how those events exactly went. But I know that it was all shifted to a virtual platform. And we continue to do that today, we continue to provide trainings online. Actually, we had a training back in February for
Person_3 | CSVANW: for sex trafficking in Indian country. And we had that presentation online. And we had over 70 participants for that training. And it would, you know, we
Person_3 | CSVANW: that's the reason why we continue to do that, because we can reach a wider audience right to share our knowledge and share those collaborations with people not just in Location_3, but from different different places across the United Location_8. And so that's how we continue to pivot for community and continue to provide accessibility for this this content and support.
Person_3 | CSVANW: and in addition to that, we also wrote a few grants and got quite a bit of money to support tribal communities with Ppe. We provided masks and hand sanitizers, and we
Person_3 | CSVANW: even purchase bulk air purifiers. We had those really really nice ones that are they're pretty large.
Person_3 | CSVANW: I believe to like a whole unit right? And you can put it in your office building and run that 24 HA day. And we were giving those out for free and those those things are very expensive.
Person_3 | CSVANW: We were giving those to tribal offices. We were giving them to, you know, spaces where tribal leaders would convene, we would give them to tribal schools, and just anywhere that we could provide that air purification device to, you know, different types of
Person_3 | CSVANW: resources. So and we still do that to this day we still have purifiers that we're giving out, and you know, to support, to support our community. And we recognize that during the pandemic, you know, there were a lot of, you know, closures of, you know, we weren't even allowed to step foot on certain reservations because they had a whole shutdown right? And they were running out of like, I know from my community. I'm from Person_4, Location_1.
Person_3 | CSVANW: That's where my family lives, and they had a whole shutdown in their community and their grocery store. They only had one grocery store, you know, and so once those supplies ran out. They were not taking in truckloads because they were on a, you know, a complete shutdown. And so once they ran out of toilet paper once they ran out of paper towels like that, was it, you know? And so we were trying to figure out, how do we respond to this? How do we get them? Resources? How do we send these supplies to these communities? And so
Person_3 | CSVANW: we had family members who were a part of those communities who would meet up, you know, with different staff or different community partners who were able to get them resources and, like meet, you know, like at the border and hand stuff over right? And so.
Person_3 | CSVANW: My goodness, it's just so crazy to think about those times again. Seems like, you know, it's just crazy times. But that's how we were responding is we were responding immediately to the needs of the communities and making sure that they received Location_9 protection resources we also gave gave out Location_9 tests for free. Once those became available and we're being mass produced. We were giving those out to community members and having them take them home to their families so that way.
Person_3 | CSVANW: if somebody got sick they immediately had a testing kit at home that they could use to test if they were positive or negative, and we continue to hand that hand those out as well. And so our Location_9, you know, mitigation that we practiced way back in [Year] and [Year] we still do to this day and provide those resources when they're needed.
[B.31] Interviewee: Wow! That's really important. Thank you so much for sharing that, Person_3.
[B.32] Interviewee: You shared so much information, you know, like just thinking about, like how you know your organization has not only responded to the different issues that were, you know, happening within the community with happening within the world, you know, with happening amongst native people like, how do you see things going into the future like, how do you anticipate what's going to happen next?
Person_3 | CSVANW: Oh, that's that's a heavy question in the, you know current space that we are in right now. As far as funding and trying to navigate some of the conversations that are happening globally and within the United Location_8. Right?
Person_3 | CSVANW: you know, I think for me personally right in this role. And my focus
Person_3 | CSVANW: for this organization is to continue to keep our focus on prevention. And we actually just received a grant which I'm really excited about to host a needs assessment across Organization_5
Person_3 | CSVANW: for our tribal communities and and urban native populations to assess where our prevention is currently at right, like what prevention work is being done in different tribal communities. And where are where are the gaps? Right? We're always trying to find the gaps.
Person_3 | CSVANW: And so we are going to be performing a needs assessment of what prevention looks like. And I'm really excited to see what comes from that, because I believe that's the future of this organization. You know, we've been doing so much, and I feel like, in a lot of ways in any any, you know, not just for tribal communities or native urban populations, but across the United Location_8.

Person_3 | CSVANW: In in this work that we do in this movement of trying to end violence against, you know, domestic violence and sexual assault, and and all, you know, harassment and stalking, and I feel like we constantly run in circles
Person_3 | CSVANW: because we are trying to provide services where services are lacking, and we're trying to get people counseling when when there are not enough therapists. We are trying to, you know, engage with our faith-based organizations to get food, and to get housing, and to get information and to share knowledge with one another when even those resources are lacking. Right?
Person_3 | CSVANW: And I feel like we're constantly running in a circle of
Person_3 | CSVANW: going back to we need resources. We need resources. We need intervention. We need to train advocates. But the turnover rate, you know, is the burnout rate and the turnover rate and the law enforcement turnover rate and the advocacy turnover, you know, it's just. I feel like we're constantly going in circles with these these different things. And for me personally, it's all about prevention. If we can get a handle on our prevention efforts.
Person_3 | CSVANW: If we can educate our communities on how we can prevent violence from happening and how we can share, you know, strategies of protecting our children from child abuse and protecting our women from domestic violence. And you know, like, there are many different ways and and research based programs that we can use and adapt for our communities to
Person_3 | CSVANW: talk about what prevention is and what prevention looks like. And through those efforts, if we can.
Person_3 | CSVANW: if we can truly find our way back to prevention, because we talk about in our trainings all the time about how
Person_3 | CSVANW: you know, violence is not traditional. That's something that we promote out there all the time. Right? There are ways that we can prevent violence from happening. And there are ways that we've known of in the past to prevent violence against our people and our families. And so I want to go back to those things, and I want to reincorporate and also pull from what we know. Now with technology and with
Person_3 | CSVANW: these research projects that have been done in multiple different communities, what have we learned from that. And how can we continue to adapt and to provide this information to our families? Because what I've seen so far since I've been in Location_3 is, and even from Location_1 when I did prevention work is we need to talk about prevention more. You know, we need this conversation to stay alive. We need to talk about. You know these different ways that folks have
Person_3 | CSVANW: found that that works right, that works with prevention. And and I believe that's where we're headed, and I and I want to spark those conversations across the State. And I want to keep those conversations alive
Person_3 | CSVANW: because there are ways right to to prevent violence from happening. And we just need to tap into that. And I believe that that's the direction we're going. And that's how we're going to get to our mission of healthy families. Healthy communities is, it starts with prevention. Intervention is great, and talking about how we can be good advocates and talking about how we can provide resources is, you know, is work that needs to be done as well. But
Person_3 | CSVANW: you know, I don't know if you've ever seen that video on Youtube. It's a great video about basically prevention in a nutshell of, they use a wonderful analogy of you need to look upstream.
Person_3 | CSVANW: And I would love to send it to you if you're interested. But basically it talks about, you know, like these these kids are falling into a river, and they're they're constantly being dragged away, you know, and they're trying to like, save the kids from the river, and they're constantly like pulling kids out of the river and pulling them out of the river, and
Person_3 | CSVANW: but nobody asked the question of, Why are the kids falling into the river, you know, and then somebody, you know goes upstream, and they see that there's a there's a hole in the bridge upstream on this river, and so all they had to do was fix the the gap, and then, you know, no kids fall into the river, and, you know, get trapped. And so
Person_3 | CSVANW: it's about looking upstream, you know. Where? Where are we needing to bridge these gaps of violence? And how can we prevent those from happening so that we, you know, people don't keep falling in the river. And it seems so simple, like such a simple concept. But it really is true. Right? I feel like we're constantly trying to save people and trying to help people, and we're bringing them in. And we're trying to, you know, build up these resources. But what we really need to do is take a step back
Person_3 | CSVANW: and figure out. You know, where is the hole, you know, and what tools do we have to to bridge, you know, to create a new bridge. Right? These are just, you know, analogies that I'm pulling from this video. But
Person_3 | CSVANW: but that's where I believe that we need to go
Person_3 | CSVANW: with our organization and with our community efforts.
[B.33] Interviewee: Absolutely
[B.34] Interviewee: well, that's really important. Thank you for sharing that, Person_3. It reminds me of that quote like Nelson, Mandela was talking about something very similar about, like, you know, we're we're doing what we can here. But we need to look up up the river to see what's going, you know, like to see why that's even happening. And that was that was one of the things that he had done as well.
Person_3 | CSVANW: Right.
[B.35] Interviewee: It's really it's really good. And with our couple of minutes that we have left, I mean, I don't want to like. I want to be respectful of your time as well, is just thinking about like if you had like a like a piece of advice that you would give to someone who wanted to also, who saw some needs in their community. What would you? What would you tell them?
Person_3 | CSVANW: Oh, if somebody asks for advice!
[B.36] Interviewee: If they saw some needs. And so like like a need of, you know, like combating violence. For example, like what the coalition does. How would how would you advise them to do similar work, or, you know, like, address those different needs in their community?
Person_3 | CSVANW: Oh, that's a really good question.
Person_3 | CSVANW: I mean number one. I would definitely advise someone to
Person_3 | CSVANW: tap into their current resources that they have available to them right? Like learning as much as you can for yourself. You know it always. It goes back down to us, too, right, you know, working on ourselves spiritually and physically. And you know the holistic approach that I talked about earlier.
[B.37] Interviewee: And.
Person_3 | CSVANW: Doing as much as you can to number One. Heal your own traumas
Person_3 | CSVANW: and you know. Mend mend the broken, you know. Right it comes with that, because what I find for myself personally is Person_5 know I have a lot of family and relatives that come to me asking for support and asking for help, you know, and they ask me for advice, and they ask me for resources. Or Xyz, and really the best thing that I can provide to them is to be an example.
Person_3 | CSVANW: you know, to be an example of this is what I've done in my own journey. This is what I know. This is what I can share with you, and that is really important. When you know, going back to being an advocate, anybody is an advocate. Right? We're not just talking about advocates who are professionals.
Person_3 | CSVANW: but advocates who.
Person_3 | CSVANW: you know, basically an advocate, is just a person that that supports, you know, another person and finding resources and finding a way to
Person_3 | CSVANW: find healing. And you know all those different different things. And so to me it starts with yourself right?
Person_3 | CSVANW: Finding as much as you can to to help yourself before you can help somebody else. That's number one. Because if we all do that I mean, think about how much healthier our communities would be right.
Person_3 | CSVANW: And so that would be number one. Number 2 would be to do as much research as you can to go to your local library and check out books on on violence, prevention, or on advocacy, or you know all those different resources, tap into your your local coalitions, reach out to see if you can volunteer, reach out to see if you could be a part of a project. You know our coalitions are all community based. And so we're all happy to pull in community voices to support this work.
Person_3 | CSVANW: In addition to that, you can attend trainings that are free. Most of our coalitions provide training for free on how to be a good advocate, how to respond to sexual assault. How does the same exam work, you know. So if a relative is going through that, you know how to support them, you know. And so there's many trainings, even not just in Location_3. But you know, across the United Location_8 that are available for folks to learn about these different things.
Person_3 | CSVANW: And lastly, if you're really passionate about it, you know, getting into to school and going to school to be an advocate, going to school, to be a lawyer, going to school, to be a tribal judge, learning how to write policy, learning how to advocate for policy, going to legislative session. You know, these are ways that you can really be involved in the work and finding a job at a local coalition, or
Person_3 | CSVANW: or, you know, a state office or a tribal office to be there to support. You know your community is, you know, another level of how you can be involved in.
Person_3 | CSVANW: I would say that you know that's different levels of of how you can be involved in the work.
[B.38] Interviewee: That's wonderful. That's really important. Because students ask those questions, too. They're like, well, how can we? You know, they like learn something. And they want to like really build upon that. And they want to figure out, you know what they're going to do. And so that's really important. That's great advice. Thank you so much, Person_3.
Person_3 | CSVANW: Absolutely.
[B.39] Interviewee: And I'm really grateful for the ways that you've like shared all these different types of information. And just you've taken this time to like, you know, talk about not only the coalition, but like how? It makes a significant difference within our communities. Were there other things that you wanted to share
[B.40] Interviewee: as part of our meeting today.
Person_3 | CSVANW: Yeah, you know, I think your questions are really thoughtful, and I really enjoyed the interview. I wasn't expecting to go into an interview today. But but I really did enjoy it. And it really, I think, helped me to reflect on the work that we're doing and how we're carrying ourselves and and like, I said, I do want to highlight a couple things. You know. I want to highlight that this work is not easy. You know we've we've had a high turnover rate as well, and I think for us, I think now our oldest employee is
Person_3 | CSVANW: you know, like 2 years into their work here. So you know, we've kind of met that threshold, you know. They say that nonprofits, you know, have a 2 year turnaround rate, and I think we are now breaking that barrier. And so that just shows that organization is becoming healthy. And you know we have a supportive environment. And but I have to say, you know, it has not been easy.
Person_3 | CSVANW: and you know there are many challenges that arise, being such, you know, being a part of such tight communities, right? We've had conflicts, and we've had, you know, just trying to navigate different types of conflicts that arise not just within, you know the the violence, you know, spectrum of what we're doing to combat violence, but also just within the work, too. Right? You know, it's sometimes it's challenging. And
Person_3 | CSVANW: every day we're learning how to improve. We're learning how to communicate better. We're learning how to put policies in place for our organization, so that we have a healthy workplace.
Person_3 | CSVANW: You know, all of those things are real and important, and I don't want to just sit here and, you know, talk about all the really great things about our work, which is awesome, but also the realities of the struggles of an organization and funding is really tight right now. And you know, we're trying to navigate that as well. And
Person_3 | CSVANW: you know we just I want to highlight to. You know the struggle a little bit right. And and also, I think, not always comes down to how we're building and bridging healthy relationships with ourselves, healthy relationships with our family, with our community, with our children. Because all of this work, you know that we're doing doesn't matter if we're not taking care of ourselves.

Page 5

Person_3 | CSVANW: And so I really want students to get a hold of that. And I know that self-care, you know, has been a huge conversation with over the past, you know. 5, 6, 7, 8, maybe 10 years now, self-care, self-care, self-care right has been thrown out there, and I think that that word and that phrase, and a lot of the things that come with self-care, I think, has gotten washed over the years of oh, yeah, we've heard it a million times. Okay, yeah, we get it self-care.
Person_3 | CSVANW: right? But I almost want to reimagine it and rethink about what does self-care mean for us? And what is a holistic approach of how I'm taking care of myself.
Person_3 | CSVANW: And in this, you know, especially in this work, it is so important. And so, if I could, you know, give one piece of advice to students of how you can really be involved is to take care of yourself, you know, and if you see something, say something right. Any ways that you can be involved in this work is to, you know.
Person_3 | CSVANW: know your resources, know, know your trusted circle, know who you can call when you're in time of need and share that information with others. And so I think that's that's kind of where I want to leave off today is is those notes.
[B.41] Interviewee: That's important and very powerful. Thank you so much, Person_3. Thank you so much for your time, and for sharing all those important insights that you're that you've, you know, learned along with, like the coalition, and like the hopes for the future, and also being real about the fact that, like these are some real concerns. You know that you're that you're also having. And yes, those are definite needs, you know, to definitely think about and like to work with for sure.
[B.42] Interviewee: And so definitely. Thank you, Person_3. Dawa. Effort. Thank thank you for taking the time to meet.
[B.43] Interviewee: And
[B.44] Interviewee: yeah, we can, if if you know, when once you talk to Tiffany, and figure out if this is what she wants to discuss as well we can. We can go from there, or we can work with what you have, and I will send the recording back to you. However, you think what is the best way to go forward.
Person_3 | CSVANW: Okay, great. Yeah, I think we can. I think this was really great, and I feel like I answered the questions to the best of my knowledge, and I will let Tiffany know that we had an interview today, and what we talked about, and if she would like to also engage in an interview. I'll leave that decision up to her, and I'll share your contact information with her. During our debrief.
[B.45] Interviewee: Wonderful. That sounds good, Person_3. Thank you. Thank you for this time. Appreciate it.
Person_3 | CSVANW: Thank you, Person_2. You all take care.
[B.46] Interviewee: You as well. Goodbye.
Person_3 | CSVANW: Bye.
