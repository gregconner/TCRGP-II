TRANSCRIPT CITATION STANDARDS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
For Research Citation (Like Chapter and Verse)
================================================================================

Date: 2026-01-01
Context: USDA-funded tribal research study

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

While there is no single universal standard for numbering transcripts, several
established approaches exist. For research citation purposes, the most common
approaches are:

1. **Line Numbers** (most common in academic research)
2. **Timestamps** (common in qualitative research, legal, media)
3. **Paragraph Numbers** (used in some disciplines)
4. **Hybrid Systems** (combining multiple methods)

RECOMMENDATION: Use line numbers for citation, as they are:
  - Standard in academic research
  - Stable (don't change if audio is re-processed)
  - Simple to reference
  - Already partially implemented in our tagging system

================================================================================
ESTABLISHED CITATION SYSTEMS
================================================================================

1. LINE NUMBERS (Most Common for Academic Research)
   Format: (Transcript Name, line 123)
   Example: "(Alaska Electric Interview, line 45)"
   
   Advantages:
   - Standard in academic research
   - Stable reference (doesn't change)
   - Simple to implement
   - Easy to cite in papers
   - Works with any transcript format
   
   Disadvantages:
   - Can shift if transcript is edited
   - Less precise than timestamps for audio alignment

2. TIMESTAMPS (Common in Qualitative Research)
   Format: (Transcript Name, 00:12:34)
   Example: "(Alaska Electric Interview, 00:12:34)"
   
   Advantages:
   - Links directly to audio/video source
   - Precise location in recording
   - Standard in qualitative research
   - Useful for verification
   
   Disadvantages:
   - Can be removed during cleaning
   - May not be available in all formats
   - Less stable if audio is re-processed

3. PARAGRAPH NUMBERS (Some Disciplines)
   Format: (Transcript Name, para. 12)
   Example: "(Alaska Electric Interview, para. 12)"
   
   Advantages:
   - Semantic units (not arbitrary)
   - Stable across formatting changes
   
   Disadvantages:
   - Less precise
   - Paragraph boundaries can be ambiguous
   - Not as common

4. HYBRID SYSTEMS
   - Line numbers + timestamps
   - Paragraph numbers + line numbers
   - Section numbers + line numbers

================================================================================
CURRENT PROGRAM BEHAVIOR
================================================================================

Our de-identification program (v1.3.0) currently:

1. REMOVES timestamps completely
   - Function: `remove_webvtt_timestamps()`
   - Removes: "00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:12.490"
   - Reason: Clean formatting

2. USES line numbers in tagging
   - Tag CSV includes: `Line_Number` column
   - Example: "Tag_Category,Line_Number,Matched_Text,Context"
   - Line numbers reference the de-identified output

3. DOES NOT preserve timestamps for citation
   - Timestamps are removed and lost
   - No citation reference system in output

PROBLEM: We're removing valuable citation information (timestamps) that could
         be useful for research purposes.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================

OPTION 1: PRESERVE TIMESTAMPS AS CITATION REFERENCES (Recommended)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Modify the program to:
  - Keep timestamps but format them as citation references
  - Format: [00:12:34] or (00:12:34) at start of each speaker turn
  - Example: "[00:12:34] Interviewer: Thank you for..."
  
  Advantages:
  ✓ Links to original audio
  ✓ Standard in qualitative research
  ✓ Precise citation
  ✓ Useful for verification
  
  Implementation:
  - Modify `remove_webvtt_timestamps()` to preserve timestamps
  - Format timestamps as citation markers
  - Keep them in de-identified output

OPTION 2: ADD LINE NUMBERS TO OUTPUT (Alternative)
---------------------------------------------------
Modify the program to:
  - Add line numbers to each line of output
  - Format: "45: Interviewer: Thank you for..."
  - Or: Number each speaker turn
  
  Advantages:
  ✓ Standard in academic research
  ✓ Simple citation format
  ✓ Stable reference
  
  Implementation:
  - Add line numbers during formatting
  - Include in output text
  - Update tag CSV to reference these numbers

OPTION 3: HYBRID: TIMESTAMPS + LINE NUMBERS (Best of Both)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Modify the program to:
  - Preserve timestamps as citation markers
  - Add line numbers for easy reference
  - Format: "[00:12:34] (line 45) Interviewer: Thank you..."
  
  Advantages:
  ✓ Links to audio (timestamps)
  ✓ Easy citation (line numbers)
  ✓ Maximum flexibility
  
  Implementation:
  - Combine both approaches
  - Format clearly for readability

OPTION 4: SECTION + LINE NUMBERS (Like Bible Chapter:Verse)
------------------------------------------------------------
Modify the program to:
  - Divide transcript into sections (by topic or question)
  - Number lines within each section
  - Format: "Section 3, line 12" or "3:12"
  
  Advantages:
  ✓ Semantic organization
  ✓ Familiar format (like Bible)
  ✓ Stable references
  
  Implementation:
  - Detect section boundaries (by question, topic, etc.)
  - Number sections and lines
  - Format as "Section:Line"

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED APPROACH FOR THIS PROJECT
================================================================================

RECOMMENDATION: OPTION 3 - HYBRID (Timestamps + Line Numbers)

Rationale:
1. Timestamps link to original audio (important for verification)
2. Line numbers provide simple citation format
3. Both are standard in academic research
4. Maximum flexibility for different citation needs

Format:
  "[00:12:34] (line 45) Interviewer: Thank you for taking the time..."

Or more compact:
  "[00:12:34:45] Interviewer: Thank you for taking the time..."
  (timestamp:line_number)

Citation Examples:
  - "(Alaska Electric Interview, 00:12:34, line 45)"
  - "(Alaska Electric Interview, line 45)" [if timestamps not needed]
  - "(Alaska Electric Interview, 00:12:34)" [if line numbers not needed]

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
================================================================================

To implement citation references in v1.3.0:

1. MODIFY `remove_webvtt_timestamps()` FUNCTION
   - Instead of removing timestamps, preserve them
   - Extract timestamp from each segment
   - Store with corresponding text

2. ADD LINE NUMBERING
   - Number each speaker turn or line
   - Track line numbers during formatting
   - Include in output

3. FORMAT CITATION MARKERS
   - Format: "[timestamp] (line N) Speaker: text"
   - Or: "[timestamp:line] Speaker: text"
   - Make clearly visible but not intrusive

4. UPDATE TAG CSV
   - Include both timestamp and line number
   - Format: "Tag_Category,Timestamp,Line_Number,Matched_Text,Context"

5. ADD CONFIGURATION OPTION
   - `preserve_timestamps_for_citation: bool = True`
   - `add_line_numbers: bool = True`
   - `citation_format: str = "hybrid"` (options: "timestamp", "line", "hybrid")

================================================================================
ACADEMIC CITATION STANDARDS
================================================================================

Common formats in academic research:

1. APA Style (American Psychological Association):
   - (Participant, personal communication, date)
   - For transcripts: (Interview Name, line number)
   - Example: "(Alaska Electric Interview, line 45)"

2. Chicago Style:
   - (Author, "Title," page/line)
   - For transcripts: (Interview Name, line number)
   - Example: "(Alaska Electric Interview, line 45)"

3. MLA Style:
   - (Author page/line)
   - For transcripts: (Interview Name, line number)
   - Example: "(Alaska Electric Interview, line 45)"

4. Qualitative Research Conventions:
   - Often use timestamps: (Interview Name, 00:12:34)
   - Or line numbers: (Interview Name, line 45)
   - Or both: (Interview Name, 00:12:34, line 45)

================================================================================
BEST PRACTICES FOR THIS PROJECT
================================================================================

Given this is a USDA-funded research study on tribal entities:

1. USE LINE NUMBERS AS PRIMARY CITATION
   - Most standard in academic research
   - Simple and clear
   - Works with any format

2. PRESERVE TIMESTAMPS AS SECONDARY REFERENCE
   - Useful for verification
   - Links to original audio
   - Standard in qualitative research

3. FORMAT CLEARLY
   - Make citation markers visible
   - Don't interfere with readability
   - Consistent format throughout

4. DOCUMENT CITATION SYSTEM
   - Explain system in methodology
   - Provide examples in documentation
   - Train researchers on citation format

5. CONSIDER PRIVACY
   - Citation references don't reveal PII
   - Line numbers are safe
   - Timestamps are safe (just time, not location/date)

================================================================================
EXAMPLE IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================

Current Output (no citation):
  "Interviewer: Thank you for taking the time to be with us..."

Proposed Output (with citation):
  "[00:00:01] (line 1) Interviewer: Thank you for taking the time to be with us..."
  "[00:00:12] (line 2) Interviewer: how you're such an advocate for your communities..."

Or more compact:
  "[00:00:01:1] Interviewer: Thank you for taking the time..."
  "[00:00:12:2] Interviewer: how you're such an advocate..."

Citation in paper:
  "As one participant noted, 'we share a lot of traditional values' 
   (Alaska Electric Interview, line 403)."

Or with timestamp:
  "As one participant noted, 'we share a lot of traditional values' 
   (Alaska Electric Interview, 00:12:34, line 403)."

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

While there's no single universal standard, line numbers are the most common
in academic research, and timestamps are standard in qualitative research.

RECOMMENDATION: Implement a hybrid system preserving both timestamps and
line numbers, formatted clearly for citation purposes. This provides maximum
flexibility and follows best practices in both academic and qualitative
research contexts.

The current program removes timestamps, which eliminates valuable citation
information. We should modify it to preserve timestamps as citation markers
while also adding line numbers for simple academic citation.
