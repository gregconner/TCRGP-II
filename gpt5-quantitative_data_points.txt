# GPT-5 Quantitative Data Point Questions for Co-op Interviews

## How to Answer While Reading an Interview Transcript
1. Read the full transcript once to understand context and actors.
2. For each metric below, search the transcript using the bolded keywords.
3. Extract the most specific numeric value. If only a range is given, pick the midpoint and note the range in your working notes.
4. If not stated, record -1 (Unknown) and add a brief note in your working notes (e.g., "not mentioned").
5. Use the allowed encodings exactly. Do not improvise new codes.
6. Prefer figures specific to the cooperative entity (not a parent nonprofit) unless explicitly stated otherwise.
7. If numbers conflict, choose the latest figure in the transcript and note the conflict in your working notes.
