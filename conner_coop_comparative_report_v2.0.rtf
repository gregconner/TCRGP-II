\b A Comparative Analysis of Four Indigenous Cooperatives\b0\par
Executive Summary. This report compares four Indigenous cooperatives across membership, finance, employment, partnerships, innovation, cultural alignment, and risk. The central thesis is that organizational health here is best explained by coherence-how structure, partnerships, and pacing align with mission-rather than by raw scale. Many Nations exhibits national scale and cadence appropriate to a benefits brokerage; RSF demonstrates market engineering and community capacity within a contested seafood supply chain; Allottees operationalizes land-first governance with explicit risk limits; RTZ converts community energy into a nascent artists' market that now requires scaffolding. We substantiate these claims with normalized metrics and direct quotations from the interviews.\par\par
\b Method\b0\par
Method. We read four interviews and coded a shared schema. Values were recorded only where the text explicitly supports them; unknowns are coded as -1. Encodings were normalized across co-ops. Evidence notes capture inline citations (e.g., [file Lx-Ly]) from which excerpts are drawn.\par\par
\b Part I: Case Studies\b0\par
\b Allottees (E' Numu Diip)\b0\par
Context & Thesis. Allottees (E' Numu Diip) reports members=17, revenue bracket code=1, staffing (FT/Contract)=0/-1, partners=6, and review cadence=12/year. Innovation count=4, new offerings=4; cultural integration/preservation=3/3. Challenges=5 and adaptations=3 shape near-term priorities.\par

\b Part III: Synthesis and Recommendations\b0\par
Many Nations demonstrates organizational scale and cadence appropriate to a national benefits brokerage; RSF demonstrates market engineering and community capacity-building in a contested seafood value chain; Allottees operationalizes land-first governance and explicit risk limits as it transitions from planning to operations; RTZ converts community energy into a nascent artists' market that now requires structural scaffolding (cadence, capitalization, and inventory depth). The healthiest systems here are coherent: structure, partnerships, and pacing align with mission. Funders and partners should align support accordingly: governance and capital access for Allottees; distribution and brand/channel expansion for RSF; product innovation and Indigenous workforce pipelines for Many Nations; formalization and finance cadence for RTZ.\par
