00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:28.020
Jodi Burshia: Well, good morning. My name is Jody Brochure, and I get a chance to work with New Mexico Highland University. Now, previously I worked with Sipi, and before that I worked with Unm. Before moving to New Mexico before moving home to New Mexico. And so now I get a chance to work with as part of like one of the different

2
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.766
Jodi Burshia: side side

3
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:44.660
Jodi Burshia: side positions that I have, I get a chance to work with this project with the Usda Grant. And it's this tribal college cooperative and getting a chance to work with all these different parts of research that are part of that.

4
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.129
Jodi Burshia: And as I was stating previously, I didn't necessarily

5
00:00:51.850 --> 00:01:07.569
Jodi Burshia: have anything had. I didn't have this type of access to different types of qualitative and quantitative data or learn how to do this until until graduate school. And so we have one student with us today who will be able to.

6
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.990
Jodi Burshia: you know, share some of this, and maybe give some different like reflections and things of that sort.

7
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.660
Jodi Burshia: But before we get into these different interview questions, do you have questions about this study before we start.

8
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.640
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: I don't have any questions.

9
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.950
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: Thank you.

10
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.245
Jodi Burshia: Absolutely so.

11
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:40.880
Jodi Burshia: One of the one of the questions deals with who you are, and then how you got into some of this work, and we will

12
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.689
Jodi Burshia: talk about that. But the 1st question is, where is your cooperative located or your organization located?

13
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:58.149
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: So we're located right now in Espanila, New Mexico, in, based in northern New Mexico table homelands.

14
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:07.386
Jodi Burshia: Wonderful, and the second one, which is partially your

15
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.990
Jodi Burshia: your bio, or your introduction is, what is your role in the position in the in the organization, in the cooperative.

16
00:02:17.317 --> 00:02:21.799
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: My role within table women united is a director.

17
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.200
Jodi Burshia: Wonderful.

18
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.170
Jodi Burshia: Do you want to say anything more about that.

19
00:02:32.075 --> 00:02:33.010
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: So

20
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:42.718
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: yeah, I've been with organization for quite some time. So part of my role is to support staff to support programs.

21
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:54.931
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: help with any sort of like onboarding or staff needs. And then also programmatic needs. So we have other program. We have 3 programs.

22
00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:12.789
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: in any way that I could support them. I kind of step in, guide them brainstorm things like that, and then also helping with grants and reviewing grant applications with our Grant support specialists, just making sure that

23
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:20.130
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: all the processes that are kind of followed and things are getting done. So that's my role.

24
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.590
Jodi Burshia: Wonderful, very important, for sure.

25
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:35.939
Jodi Burshia: So with that, what brought the community together to start the cooperative or your organization for the original vision, for what you wanted to do for table women United.

26
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:39.464
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: I

27
00:03:40.490 --> 00:04:07.300
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: believe from what I've learned in the past. In 1989, their organization, officially kind of came together as an all volunteer group, and so they had noticed and identified issues in the community that were affecting Pueblo women, table women here in Northern New Mexico, through the table speaking communities.

28
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:24.330
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: There were several issues that were identified, such as alcoholism, sexual abuse, domestic violence, drug and alcohol use, suicide, a lot of just social ills that were happening. And so they came together to

29
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.990
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: really support one another, to be there for each other, and then also to

30
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:51.099
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: serve as like a space to heal and grow and also help each other. Really combat. I don't want to say combat, but really take on alternative ways to heal community and also address some of the issues that were happening and practice advocacy

31
00:04:51.616 --> 00:04:54.390
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: for the variety of things that were happening.

32
00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:02.820
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: a result of the reason. One of the reasons. Also they started was because they started to see a lot of

33
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:11.210
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: contamination in the area as a result of nuclear facilities. And here in northern New Mexico, where

34
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:30.709
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: literally, like 2015 min away from Los Alamos National Laboratory. And so there's been a lot of environmental injustices that have happened. And so the community came together from all the 6 Taylor speaking communities to address and advocate, for against these issues.

35
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:41.000
Jodi Burshia: Absolutely thank you for doing that. That's huge. And it's important, absolutely.

36
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:52.290
Jodi Burshia: which leads us to this next question. Some indigenous communities use cooperatives to reinforce traditional systems and values of native nations. Do you feel like that's the case here.

37
00:05:53.597 --> 00:05:58.457
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: Definitely like I, I feel like table women united. Has

38
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:05.988
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: really worked hard over the years to address some of the gaps that exist in our communities.

39
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:21.348
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: we're not tribally affiliated with any sort of Pablo or any sort of tribal council. We're a standalone, 5 0. 1 c. 3, which we were granted in 2,001 and so we

40
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:31.515
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: we definitely have created, like this alternative space for women and children and advocates of Mother Earth to

41
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:57.919
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: be able to bring change in community. And so that was one of the original missions of the organization was to become change agents in our community and to empower women to uncover their power as well. And so this organization is like centered around native women. We're native women led, and we really try to remain centered in that aspect of our work

42
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.609
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: to ensure that we're uplifting other native women and girls

43
00:07:03.088 --> 00:07:05.660
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: to become advocates in their community.

44
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:17.020
Jodi Burshia: This is wonderful, so important that your organization is there, and that it does the important work that it's doing. Thank you for doing this, Nathanya.

45
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.460
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: Thank you.

46
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.179
Jodi Burshia: You and your team. Yes.

47
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:21.730
Jodi Burshia: So

48
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:36.620
Jodi Burshia: how did the cooperative members learn like? How did the local nations, or native or the local pueblos learn about what this cooperative is and should be and do like. How did you start this within your community?

49
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.640
Jodi Burshia: Did you learn from like another organization and say, like, I want to do something similar to that?

50
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:44.760
Jodi Burshia: Or how did it get started?

51
00:07:45.976 --> 00:07:47.560
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: That's a good question.

52
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:55.132
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: I actually haven't asked that question before. From my understanding.

53
00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:10.830
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: a lot of it was really just about taking the initiative and coming together around a kitchen table. Right? So a lot of these conversations, are happening in people's homes and people's kitchen tables. And so

54
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:27.227
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: I I from what I know, is that the organization really started at that place? In somebody's home around the kitchen table, thinking through like, how do we address some of these issues? There was a lot of alcohol

55
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:36.449
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: dependency happening at that time, and I think folks were trying to get sober in the time that this organization was created. And so

56
00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:52.429
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: there was a lot of just this moment of like healing or or going through their own growth process as young women in in the late eighties. Right? And so they were also trying to find alternatives, for how do they heal? And how do they?

57
00:08:53.369 --> 00:09:07.459
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: builds on the skills and practices they have. So even things such as pottery and jewelry, sewing things like that is trying to create like spaces for women, to to

58
00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:17.607
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: become independent, to pursue entrepreneurship. To really think about like the social enterprise aspect of everything.

59
00:09:18.735 --> 00:09:22.424
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: and so a lot of it, I think, was self taught.

60
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:52.470
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: I. It was all volunteer group. And so at some point, they didn't even get paid for the work that they did right in the beginning, and they all felt a need for change in community. And so they did what they could to better themselves to maintain their sobriety, and then also eventually establishing the 501 c. 3. Status, which is not easy, and eventually

61
00:09:53.670 --> 00:10:05.039
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: applying for grants, getting funding, hiring staff. And so the organization has been in existence over 35, 36 years now. And so

62
00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:21.599
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: it's taken a lot of work, but it's grown so much, and they have an amazing staff and structure now that has kind of grown and shifted over the years from when it 1st began.

63
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.449
Jodi Burshia: That's wonderful. Thank you so much for sharing that Nathanya.

64
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.849
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: Yeah, I'm wondering also, too, like

65
00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:43.179
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: this might be it might be good to also interview corrine, because she may have a lot more insight into, like the historical aspects of table. Mean? I did, and how those like initial decisions were made.

66
00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:49.239
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: To start the organization and also to to

67
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.680
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: like the the establishment of it.

68
00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.590
Jodi Burshia: Absolutely

69
00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:04.629
Jodi Burshia: well, maybe we can set up another time that works for both of you. So we could, you know, ask about some of those those initial historical questions.

70
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:05.920
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: Okay.

71
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:07.519
Jodi Burshia: That'd be great.

72
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.910
Jodi Burshia: So let's see.

73
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:17.870
Jodi Burshia: she wouldn't have, because the question is to begin the cooperative. How did you find membership producers?

74
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:22.100
Jodi Burshia: Do you feel like? Do you feel comfortable answering that? Or should we wait for corrine.

75
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:27.419
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: Yeah, I don't know that part. I know that the one thing I do know is that

76
00:11:28.138 --> 00:11:53.060
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: there was a really strong push to ensure that there was representatives from all 6 tables, speaking communities. And so because we're table women united, there's always been this importance of maintaining that connection back to representing the 6 tableau speaking communities or the women of those 6 Taylor speaking communities.

77
00:11:53.483 --> 00:12:20.580
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: That's who we center right in the work that we do. And so I know that in the beginning that was key to establishing the group of women that came together to to organize even in our previous logo like the original logo. It has 6 little ladies around the center, and they represent the 6 table speaking communities so that that I know

78
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.639
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: that I'm very certain about.

79
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.200
Jodi Burshia: Wonderful.

80
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:38.589
Jodi Burshia: That's huge. That's important, especially when people are looking at something they're like. Oh, that includes me, that includes, you know. Like, if you're from those different speaking communities here, and you want to be seen. And that's and that's important. Thank you for doing that.

81
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:50.440
Jodi Burshia: Which leads to my next question, did your cooperative adapt or adopt standard cooperative development approaches to meet the needs of your community?

82
00:12:52.720 --> 00:13:04.970
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: So a lot of it is really based on table philosophy and our values as an organization or values that we maybe grew up with

83
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:22.362
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: sort of really embracing the Tewa perspective and Tewa teachings. As a kid, you grow up with certain values and understandings and aspects of life. And these

84
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:38.760
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: particular teachings have been foundational or really instrumental in the way that we have shaped the organization. And so all of our values are based on Tewa

85
00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:50.239
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: frameworks, table philosophies. So that we are in relationship with that aspect of who we are as table people, and also coming from that

86
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:59.679
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: frame of mind. When we're when we're doing our work. And also even with those that we try our best to teach, those that

87
00:14:00.149 --> 00:14:04.339
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: are coming into the organization now to really be mindful of just

88
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:11.180
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: practices and protocols, and also the philosophy of where how we view the world.

89
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.049
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: And so that was

90
00:14:13.799 --> 00:14:31.530
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: that's like the guiding part behind the organization as far as like the organizational structure, and the development of that is really based on like a consensus and not so much like very Westernized

91
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:42.430
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: approach to how you would run an organization. But really around old traditional practices

92
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:51.099
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: that involve consensus or community buy-in or community support community.

93
00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:59.460
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: How would you say, like community input and how we how we organize

94
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:04.910
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: and focus on the issues that we work on. So there's like a

95
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:12.730
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: Oh, I can't even remember it's in our handbook. But there's like a our board operates with like a consensus base.

96
00:15:13.611 --> 00:15:21.958
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: Approach. That is definitely not like we don't follow Robert's rules of order in that way.

97
00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:29.349
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: because it's so. We're we're not trying to be very Westernized in that sense.

98
00:15:29.895 --> 00:15:34.999
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: Because that's not who we are. And that's not how we operate.

99
00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:45.100
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: But we really want to ensure that we're serving everybody and including everybody in our decision making. So that's that's pretty much how it's been from the beginning.

100
00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:48.160
Jodi Burshia: That's awesome.

101
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:49.960
Jodi Burshia: This is great.

102
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:58.190
Jodi Burshia: So how do you keep tribal leadership engaged? Because with some of our pueblos, you know, like changing leadership

103
00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:05.520
Jodi Burshia: every couple of years. Sometimes. How does that factor into keeping leadership engaged.

104
00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:17.460
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: We definitely try our best to engage in tribal communities. We aren't a tribal entity, and so

105
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.370
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: we don't necessarily get involved in like

106
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:37.669
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: they have 8 Northern Indian public governors, council meetings, and things like that. We don't really participate in that area because we're not a tribal entity. And so what we do is we partner directly with the community organizations that are

107
00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:50.652
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: connected to the 8 Northern or, yeah, pretty much the 8 Northern pueblos, specifically, the Taylor speaking communities. Because there's others that are not

108
00:16:51.280 --> 00:17:13.060
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: Those Pickerys and Taos are not part of the Tewa speaking language group. And so we try our best to maintain our relationships to social services, departments to also domestic violence, organizations or entities within tribal communities.

109
00:17:13.585 --> 00:17:21.200
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: To wellness circles. Whether they have like a wellness program or we have different

110
00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:31.310
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: agencies or departments within the tribes that we work with, based on the programming that we need to provide. So we don't necessarily like go to tribal government and present

111
00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:57.680
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: on what we have to offer in the past. We also did have a resolution that we had established with the 8 Northern Indian Public Council to just recognize the work that we're doing as a 501 c. 3 in Indian country or within Tewa homelands, just so that they're aware that we're an organization that is also serving native women, but is not

112
00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:06.759
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: directly tied to a tribe and so we basically run. I would say, kind of

113
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:22.057
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: parallel to tribal entities. But we're we're also not affiliated with them. So we're in the same circle. Sometimes we're connecting with their organizations, but we don't necessarily

114
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.990
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: have any sort of

115
00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:49.920
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: regular check-ins with like tribal council, or anything like that. If we're working within the schools or with working within the communities where we have to run programming or collect data or surveys, those are areas where we definitely need like tribal approval and ensure that they know that we're coming into community. So we we follow the protocols wherever we need to when we're working within their communities.

116
00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:55.800
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: But to keep them in the know of what we're doing, we basically

117
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.689
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: work directly with tribal entities and programs.

118
00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:02.590
Jodi Burshia: Wonderful.

119
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.180
Jodi Burshia: Thank you for that.

120
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:09.820
Jodi Burshia: And do you feel like your organization? Is there any other organization that does similar work.

121
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:26.300
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: yes. So we. So we offer a variety of things. We offer. We have 3 programs, our gender justice program, our environmental justice program and our reproductive justice program.

122
00:19:27.343 --> 00:19:38.636
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: So we offer sometimes things that maybe others may not. So like within our reproductive justice program, we offer Doula services.

123
00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:57.170
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: I don't know of any other organization in this particular area within the northern Santa Fe County and Southern Rioreba County table area table homelands area that offers Doula services.

124
00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:16.990
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: One of the organizations that we work closely with is breath of my heart. They're a birth center located in Espaniola, which we were also part of helping to develop in the early stages of that organization, and they provide midwife care.

125
00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:31.280
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: maternal health clinics. And then also, just like general clinic checkups. They're they're also doing reproductive justice work as well. They do community distributions, such as

126
00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:46.608
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: diaper drives which we collaborate on food drives things like that. So they they work. They're very similar to our reproductive justice program, but they offer midwifery. And we offer Doula services. So we work pretty much in relationship with each other.

127
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:57.569
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: If if we have a client that is looking for a midwife, we usually refer them to breath of my heart. So that that's 1 area.

128
00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:11.720
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: the other organizations that may also do similar work to us is public Action alliance. They're also younger.

129
00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:21.140
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: I don't think they've established 501 c. 3 status yet. But they do a lot of environmental justice advocacy work through a public perspective.

130
00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:44.359
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: And so we work with them from time to time through our environmental justice program, doing legislative policy, advocacy, work, social engagement campaigns around any sort of nuclear contamination or any sort of nuclear environmental justice, advocacy.

131
00:21:44.500 --> 00:22:03.739
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: They also do like fellowships. And sometimes we have like internships. So they're similar, but not the same. And they mainly serve. I think a lot of it is engaging young people in the environmental justice world. So we work with them pretty similarly, they do different things. We do more of like

132
00:22:04.599 --> 00:22:10.489
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: the nuclear focus pieces and they do oil and gas

133
00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:27.739
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: and then also, we're working on like seed sovereignty work to maintain traditional heirloom seeds. Maintaining traditional agricultural practices, teaching folks about herbal medicine. So we have, like

134
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:33.389
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: a variety of things they do. But also we have, like a different aspect of the work.

135
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:42.390
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: And then for our gender justice program. That's really around preventing sexual violence and gender-based violence. And so

136
00:22:42.460 --> 00:23:09.139
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: their coalition to stop violence against native women is very similar to the work that we do, and also planned. Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains is also very similar to the work that we do we teach sexual health education in the schools for middle school and high school students? We run curricula in grade school and also in middle school and high school. That's

137
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:23.539
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: a curricula. That's a culturally based curricula on preventing gender-based violence. And so that one is really about understanding relationships and power dynamics consent

138
00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:42.770
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: bystander intervention. And so the coalition also provides that sort of training as well. They do a lot of advocacy work for sexual assault victims, and they're, I think, they don't do direct services, but they're a referral system or a resource.

139
00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:56.720
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: We don't do sexual violence or sexual assault work directly anymore. A lot of our work is really focused on the prevention aspect and being in the schools and working with young people.

140
00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:21.929
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: So that's pretty similar. The other group, I would say that we're pretty similar to is Table Root Society, and they're based out of Nambay. They do a youth council which we do as well. The one cool thing about Table Root society that we don't do is they provide clinical services for folks in the community and also in recovery.

141
00:24:22.291 --> 00:24:30.709
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: And so we partner with them from time to time, utilizing some of their services, and also them just teaching us different aspects of our work.

142
00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:37.947
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: There's a couple of others. That are non native as well.

143
00:24:39.288 --> 00:24:55.901
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: actually, there's yeah. So the other one would be resolve. They do bystander intervention. They do conflict mediation. And we we kind of teach similar curricula in that way. They're based out of Santa Fe.

144
00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:13.100
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: there's another organization, hope, honor, our Pueblo existence. And they're based out of Santa Clara. And we work with them on environmental justice issues and also cultural preservation work as well. So there's probably a couple of others.

145
00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:42.150
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: We've worked with Zuni Enrichment project in a cohort or grantees which they also do. Youth work and outdoor education as well. That's something that we're now exploring is outdoor youth, education, and enrichment. And so we are learning more about how to connect the young people to environmental justice and doing the overlap between our Ej program and our gender justice program.

146
00:25:42.732 --> 00:25:50.480
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: So we have quite a few partnerships and people that we've worked with pretty regularly. But I think those are like the

147
00:25:51.286 --> 00:25:57.813
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: like the tribal led or native led organizations that we work with more closely.

148
00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:19.930
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: right now we're working with Nambay, healthy families. We're going to be providing a book club for their women's circle and then also working with them on a domestic violence awareness conference coming up now in October. So we that that's a newer relationship that we are working with pretty regularly with them.

149
00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:24.849
Jodi Burshia: That's wonderful. Thank you for sharing that, Natanya.

150
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:31.650
Jodi Burshia: Is the management volunteer paid, or a combination.

151
00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:50.239
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: So we have a pretty strong volunteer base. This is one we for. So each program is run differently, right? In terms of volunteers. Our environmental justice program is the one that really revive

152
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:59.730
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: relies a lot on volunteers. They, because we have the Espanula healing foods oasis at the Espanola Vaultes Park.

153
00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:22.719
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: We constantly need support to pull weeds, to haul rocks, to plant plants, to harvest things, and so we are right now trying to strengthen our volunteer base because we're definitely going to need support in the garden as well as we have a diaper donation closet that we're trying to get

154
00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:34.246
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: donated diapers to families and communities. And so this is like a new thing for us. As we expand our programming and we open up

155
00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:42.260
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: these sort of like supply drives in a way. So we haven't really like had like a managed

156
00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:49.219
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: volunteer process. So we actually just talked about this yesterday at our staff meeting.

157
00:27:50.160 --> 00:28:08.499
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: our previous communication, or one of our communication support person, actually helped us with some volunteer management a few years back. But she stepped back from that role. And so right now, we're trying to figure out how to really manage our active volunteer base.

158
00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:32.569
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: there's frameworks that we've seen from other organizations who rely heavily on volunteers to show up and help and I think we need to tap into that. So we also don't burn ourselves out, and also that we can expand our capacity as an organization as well. So this is something we're still kind of trying to sit with and figure out how to how to make better.

159
00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:42.129
Jodi Burshia: Awesome. Yes, that's definitely one of the processes of you know, figuring out what works for your organization and all of that.

160
00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:56.750
Jodi Burshia: Thank you for sharing that. So that, did your cooperative or your or your organization develop a marketing plan like, How are you? How do you let people know about all these wonderful services that you were that you were doing.

161
00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:12.300
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: So right now we have a marketing consultant. We have a communications consultant, actually. And then we're working. So I I really like marketing and branding. So that's also part of my role is to

162
00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:33.389
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: just sort of see these projects through right? And so right now we have a communications person who was our previous fundraiser. And she's amazing in what she does. So she helps us with our social media, our Facebook, our Instagram. We also have a blue sky account now

163
00:29:33.960 --> 00:30:03.830
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: our Linkedin account. And so she helps maintain all of those pieces of our work to get the word out to share flyers to share campaigns to share information, and she also works on our monthly newsletter. So we have a monthly newsletter that goes out every month sharing the work that we're doing, any sort of like wins or areas where we need action alerts for people to show up. So she manages that she oversees our website to keep that updated with staff.

164
00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:12.670
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: And right now we're actually going through a I wouldn't call it like a a branding

165
00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:37.970
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: process. But we're really trying to more like indigenize our image a little bit more. So we're working with the graphic designer now to help us create some indigenized content. To create templates, to create letterheads, business cards, things like that, so that our imagery kind of looks succinct. And we're

166
00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:57.581
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: really kind of tapping into that like Pueblo perspective. Pablo. Imagery. A little bit more. And so this is the part that I really like is working with the staff to establish certificates that are native design so that they can give to their

167
00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:22.940
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: participants that are getting certified in different trainings that we offer. And so we're trying to make sure that, like, we're being intentional about the type of gifting items that we give to different people, whether it's like a scarf or like a basket. And so all of those things we're trying to just maintain. Sort of that Pablo, and traditional native aspect of the work that we do.

168
00:31:23.288 --> 00:31:32.699
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: And so yeah, we're we. We try our best. We have like a branding guide that we utilize as well. Our logo has to have a specific

169
00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:39.700
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: like placement on certain colors, the background. And so we have, like a

170
00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:46.600
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: branding guide that we utilize and all staff utilizes and we ask Staff to sort of maintain this

171
00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:49.873
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: this aspect of their branding.

172
00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:54.363
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: and so the social media is probably our biggest

173
00:31:55.020 --> 00:32:18.750
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: outreach channel right now, and then, also trying our best to stay up to date with like newsletter writings or newspaper articles and things like that. We have a couple of local newspapers that we write articles in every now and then. And so that's something that we're trying to maintain as well.

174
00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:22.310
Jodi Burshia: That's wonderful. That's really important.

175
00:32:23.273 --> 00:32:27.699
Jodi Burshia: All of these things make your organization successful.

176
00:32:29.379 --> 00:32:38.380
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: Most definitely. I think the social media presence is definitely where we get a lot of

177
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:50.430
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: inquiries. Our emails are always filled with our general email. We have a general email. And people are like, I've seen this on social media, or I've seen this and this and that. And

178
00:32:50.430 --> 00:33:11.490
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: that's how we get outreach for all of our groups and our campaigns. And so we've tried putting flyers up around town, too, because sometimes people don't have Internet and so, or they're not on social media. And so every now and then we'll do some paper canvassing around town or in the tribal communities.

179
00:33:12.426 --> 00:33:18.750
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: Excuse me, too. Ensure that those that don't have access to Internet are also informed.

180
00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:33.980
Jodi Burshia: Absolutely, that's really important. And thinking about all the different avenues that you just mentioned. So as part of that, how do you think your organization was impacted by Covid-nineteen.

181
00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:42.390
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: Hmm, we actually did a very big evaluation study at that point.

182
00:33:43.159 --> 00:33:44.259
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: Through Covid.

183
00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:45.080
Jodi Burshia: But.

184
00:33:45.558 --> 00:33:50.341
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: Because we had to pivot in so many different ways.

185
00:33:51.010 --> 00:34:12.110
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: so we worked on a, we worked on a evaluation process to really think about like how covid impacted community organizations, and also our community in general, really thinking about, like their mind, heart, body, and spirit, and like what was needed or what comes next. As we come to this next iteration of

186
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:15.474
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: I don't want to say post covid, but

187
00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.339
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: of the journey in in this

188
00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:36.399
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: in the world, right around pandemics and around social ills, and just all of those pieces. And so one of the things is that we had to pivot virtually in all areas of our work. So if we were implementing curricula in the schools, all schools went

189
00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:47.469
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: virtual, right? So we also had to go all virtual be in zooms with students all day, or presenting in their classroom for certain times, and

190
00:34:47.580 --> 00:35:10.509
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: that was like a big pivot for us. Same thing with our Doula services all Doula services had to go virtual. We were not allowed into hospitals if parents were giving birth, and so we had to provide virtual services to clients throughout the iteration of their birth process. And then, after for postnatal care and postpartum care

191
00:35:10.903 --> 00:35:22.699
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: our environmental justice program actually got more access to some of the meetings that were happening, because they were no longer held only in person. But they were now held

192
00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:52.620
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: in online. And so this really allowed access for our community to be able to participate in meetings. So that was like. One good thing about Covid is that it really forced Federal agencies to host meetings virtually so that it allowed people to actually get involved. And so if you couldn't make it to an in person meeting prior to Covid. You just missed the meeting, and you were not able to provide a comment, whereas now legislative processes and also

193
00:35:53.365 --> 00:36:13.229
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: Federal agency processes now include like a hybrid option. So that's something that is actually really great. Because when we need folks to show up and they're not able to physically show up in the room. They're able to get online and access the meetings that we need people to show up at. And so that was like a good thing for Covid.

194
00:36:13.573 --> 00:36:26.619
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: We still offer some of the same things like, if we need to do trainings online for schools or or people we work with for the curricula. We'll still do that. So some things have remained in place.

195
00:36:27.151 --> 00:36:37.090
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: The one thing that I think as an organization impacted us was really just the

196
00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:44.090
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: work culture around hybrid and remote work schedules. So last year

197
00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:47.600
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: was it last year 2023

198
00:36:48.981 --> 00:36:53.010
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: we were still working, primarily remote.

199
00:36:53.180 --> 00:37:05.160
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: 2024 calendar year. January of 2024. We officially had all staff come into office.

200
00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:22.875
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: not all primarily remote. So we all had to like shift from working remote in 2023 to being in person in the office. In 2024. And so last year we had a lot of turnover because we had folks

201
00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:44.200
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: In the early of 2024 who were living in other areas, such as Albuquerque, and providing virtual services to clients that were not able to commute and come into the office 3 days a week. We had a we had a 24 h, 3 days a week minimum that we had folks needing to come into the office.

202
00:37:44.430 --> 00:38:06.510
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: And so we had a lot of turnover. The work culture around hybrid work was definitely impactful on our work. And then also, we serve community right? So we serve schools. We serve folks who need diapers, folks who need menstrual products, folks who may need postpartum support. And so

203
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:28.503
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: sometimes clients are showing up, and there would be nobody there. And so we really had to think about like the needs of the organization and the needs of the community. In terms of hybrid work schedules. So we've we've kind of struggled with that through last year. We did have high turnover because folks weren't able to commit to the to the commute

204
00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:53.954
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: which I think we knew was gonna happen when we made that policy. So we've we have revised that policy a little bit. And we've really tried to hone in on hiring folks within a certain region. Because we know the commute so much. Right? So if you're traveling an hour and a half every day from here to Albuquerque, it gets a lot. And so

205
00:38:54.730 --> 00:39:06.829
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: Somebody that's really committed could possibly do it every day, but also even myself. I don't know if I could do that every day for 5 days, a week, or 4 days a week.

206
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:11.760
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: So we did have. That was like a

207
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:27.949
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: that was like an eye opening experience after Covid is just like the shift in work culture. People did not want to come into the office, and they did not want to commute. So it was different. It was different, and it also

208
00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:31.850
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: still angers for people that are new hires as well.

209
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:41.936
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: So we have a lot of inquiries around remote work. But a big thing for us is that we serve community and we have to be here for community

210
00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:58.730
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: and that's that's who we serve right. So we're not like a tech company that can remote in and do certain things. We're really about serving community and being here. So it's it's kind of tough. That part is tough.

211
00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:06.140
Jodi Burshia: Absolutely that is definitely challenging for sure. And thank you for sharing that with us.

212
00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:11.377
Jodi Burshia: So as you're thinking about the future, all of these different

213
00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:29.979
Jodi Burshia: issues and well things that you that have been successful to the organization. How do you envision? What will happen for the future like? Especially for like including native peoples, including different initiatives or differing, including like things for the future. How do you? How do you see that looking.

214
00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:39.640
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: So right now, I think most of our programs are really

215
00:40:40.355 --> 00:40:45.710
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: picking up momentum. And last year, in 2024,

216
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:50.059
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: 25 was a lot about

217
00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:56.640
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: getting back into community and really connecting back with our partners that we hadn't done work with

218
00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:03.219
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: because of Covid and so there was. There was a lot of

219
00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:12.644
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: missed connections that had taken place because we weren't in office. We weren't offering hybrids. We weren't offering in person things

220
00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:40.954
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: And so last year we definitely like got out into community. We connected with people. We were back. We were back in the schools for the 1st time, like very consistently, we were hosting in person gatherings, all of those things. And so now folks are definitely in this, like settled space of like, all right, this is our flow like this is how we're gonna be doing our work.

221
00:41:41.950 --> 00:42:00.780
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: and I think a lot of people are inspired about like, how do we maintain what we have? And then also grow a little bit, but not too much, because you don't want to burn out and so we, we started a new process within our project planning to allow program managers to

222
00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:21.509
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: have some autonomy over the programs that they that they develop right, or that they that they implement. And so they were able to develop their own goals. They were able to develop sort of like, how they want to expand their programs. We have a couple of staff who have been with us over 2 years are going to be 2 years. And so that is

223
00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:34.910
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: amazing, because in the time of Covid we didn't have long term staff and so now they're able to see their projects through. Some program. 2 program. Managers of ours

224
00:42:35.459 --> 00:42:49.879
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: were able to see their project budgets through one whole fiscal year, now ending in July, or June first, st June 30, th and so now they were able to develop a new budget and be be able to

225
00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:57.281
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: have that year of experience to see their projects through, and then now develop their own new projects. So

226
00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:08.770
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: we're really kind of some. Some of our staff is really hopeful in that. They want to expand. But I try to like. Keep them. I think myself and corrine really try to keep them

227
00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:18.320
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: at this place of remembering like you don't want to burn yourself out like. It's amazing to do all the work that you want to do. It's amazing to have all these groups you want to hold. But also

228
00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:40.810
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: you don't want to overwork yourself or your staff to where they don't even want to show up to work. So staff wellness has been like a big priority for us lately, ensuring that we have healthcare for our staff, ensuring that right now we're trying to work on retirement for our staff. Nonprofits usually don't have retirement. And so this is something that we're really trying to work towards.

229
00:43:42.870 --> 00:44:00.239
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: And I think for the future. We're really looking at like, how do we start to think about creative revenue aspects of our work right? And so we have some potential opportunities for

230
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:20.620
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: generating some revenue to help the organization so thankfully, we don't have Federal grants. So we weren't impacted by a lot of the work or a lot of policies that were implemented this year. And so we're able to really kind of think through. What does it look like for us to

231
00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:35.459
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: financially sustain ourselves and not be dependent primarily on grants? Right? So when your grant gets cut or your grant goes away like you got to think about like, do I downsize, do I not?

232
00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:57.030
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: And so right now we've really been thinking about and expanding our understanding around financial wellbeing and financial stability and sustainability around creative revenue structures and also social entrepreneurship, social enterprise. So this is like a new conversation for us is because we've never really done this before.

233
00:44:57.559 --> 00:45:02.140
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: We do. We do train Doulas. We certify Doulas

234
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:15.240
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: in our curricula. The State of New Mexico is now offering Doula reimbursements for Medicaid, and so we're teaching folks how to establish their own businesses as Doulas

235
00:45:15.679 --> 00:45:36.240
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: and how to really tap into utilizing their own skills, to help them generate revenue as well. So not only for the organization, but also for those we serve for our clients for other folks that maybe want to be trained in certain aspects of their work. So

236
00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:40.809
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: This is like a new thing for us is really thinking about

237
00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:48.339
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: that entrepreneur aspect, the social enterprise, aspect. And so the future is kind of

238
00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:58.179
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: like a little bit hazy, because we're still like walking in this new path of like, what does it look like to create these

239
00:45:58.862 --> 00:46:16.197
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: alternative revenue generators? We have a old building that we just started renting out. And so we're generating a little bit of revenue there. But this is the 1st time we've ever been like renters or landlords in a way.

240
00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:23.739
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: so it's it's a new process for us to really think about that part. For the organization. So.

241
00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:27.699
Jodi Burshia: Wow! This is

249
00:47:03.734 --> 00:47:05.260
ohshumus hall: My name is Seamus Hall.

250
00:47:05.781 --> 00:47:09.439
ohshumus hall: I'm from the Coral Indian Nation, which is on the coast of Washington.

251
00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:17.420
ohshumus hall: and this is my second year of Sippy, and my very 1st time working on a grant. And it's been amazing so far, learned so much.

252
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:22.639
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: Awesome. Thank you. Nice to meet you.

253
00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:25.270
Jodi Burshia: Wonderful.

254
00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:49.829
Jodi Burshia: Thank you for taking the time to work with us, to to share some information. And I'm excited to see what you and your organization are going to do for the future. I've been following along for a while. So it's just exciting to to see all the different ways like, Oh, okay, United is doing this and this and this. And it's just exciting.

255
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:54.499
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: Yeah, thank you so much. We definitely have, like.

256
00:47:54.700 --> 00:48:22.770
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: amped up our our offerings to community this last year. And actually, we're pretty much doubling it now for this current calendar year. So our staff is working hard. Everybody's doing an amazing job. I just worry about their burnout. I worry about like. I don't want them to think we're like pushing them this hard, but they're also really inspired by the work that they do and the people they serve. And so I think that's what kind of

257
00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:39.939
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: pushes them towards that next area of like. Oh, we got to offer more, and I'm like, no like you're already doing enough like you don't need to do no more. And so but they also see the needs, right, the needs of our communities and the the gaps that exist. And and how do you address those

258
00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:44.680
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: with the, with the tiny amount of

259
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:55.950
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: time and money and funding that you have sometimes. And so it gets a little bit worrisome. And also, I think, weighs heavy on people when they start to notice

260
00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:19.520
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: areas of the community that need support. So it's it's it's rewarding. And also it gets a little bit like worrisome from time to time. So I I just hope that they. They also maintain themselves, and we continue to do do the good work. We also have our circle of elders and grandmothers, and they help us also maintain

261
00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:28.630
Nathana Bird | Tewa Women United: just that rootedness back to like. How do you take care of yourself? This is what we learned in the past, and like they teach us through their wisdom. So it's really helpful.

262
00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:32.320
Jodi Burshia: Absolutely. That's extremely important as well.

263
00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:33.800
