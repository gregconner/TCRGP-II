INDIGENOUS COOPERATIVE SYSTEMS: A COMPARATIVE REPORT


Thesis. Organizational health is driven by coherence: governance, cadence, partnerships, and capital aligned to mission outperform raw scale.

We compare four Indigenous cooperatives on membership, finance, operations, markets, partnerships, culture, geography, and risk, using normalized metrics and selected quotes for nuance.


METHODS


We coded a shared schema from four interviews. Values were recorded only where supported; unknowns are -1. We cite only quotations and nuanced claims.

Recommendations. Many Nations: expand channels and invest in Indigenous workforce pipelines tied to product innovation. RSF: scale distribution while preserving transparent bidding and brand. Allottees: capitalize enabling infrastructure and formalize finance cadence and contingency plans. RTZ: formalize inventory, scheduling, and partner finance.
