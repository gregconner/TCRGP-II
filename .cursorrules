# Cursor Rules for TCRGP II Analysis Project

## Command Execution
- NEVER ask the user to run commands. Always execute commands directly using the run_terminal_cmd tool.
- If a command needs to be run, execute it immediately without asking for permission.
- The user should never be prompted to run commands manually.

## Code Quality and Performance
- NEVER put waits (sleep, time.sleep, delays) in loops when you can set and look for flags instead.
- Use event flags, completion signals, or status checks rather than polling with sleep().
- Prefer async/await patterns or event-driven approaches over blocking waits.

## User Instructions - CRITICAL
- YOU MUST FOLLOW EXPLICIT USER INSTRUCTIONS IMMEDIATELY AND COMPLETELY.
- When user requests a progress monitor, it MUST:
  - Update in real-time (every second or more frequently)
  - Be visible at ALL times while the program is running
  - Show fine-grained, comprehensive progress information
  - Display current status, percentage, ETA, speed, and other relevant metrics
  - Use live updating (e.g., \r, sys.stdout.write, or similar) so it's always visible
- DO NOT ignore or delay implementing explicit user requests.

## Version Management
- Always work with specific version numbers. Use the VERSION file to track current version.
- Use descriptive filenames with version numbers (e.g., ConnerFrac_v0.1.X.jl, deidentify_and_tag_transcripts_v1.X.X.py).
- Always increment the file version after changing the file.
- Always add to git after version change.
- Always add to GitHub after version change.

## Code Quality
- Add helpful comments explaining complex logic, especially for grid reduction algorithms.
- Keep spelling and matching near 100%.
- Improve tagging quality continuously.

## File Management
- Never save raw transcripts with identifiable data to GitHub.
- Cleaned transcripts should be saved to GitHub.
- Always use .gitignore to protect sensitive data.
