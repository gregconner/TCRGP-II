# Cursor Rules for TCRGP II Analysis Project

## Command Execution
- NEVER ask the user to run commands. Always execute commands directly using the run_terminal_cmd tool.
- If a command needs to be run, execute it immediately without asking for permission.
- The user should never be prompted to run commands manually.

## Version Management
- Always work with specific version numbers. Use the VERSION file to track current version.
- Use descriptive filenames with version numbers (e.g., ConnerFrac_v0.1.X.jl, deidentify_and_tag_transcripts_v1.X.X.py).
- Always increment the file version after changing the file.
- Always add to git after version change.
- Always add to GitHub after version change.

## Code Quality
- Add helpful comments explaining complex logic, especially for grid reduction algorithms.
- Keep spelling and matching near 100%.
- Improve tagging quality continuously.

## File Management
- Never save raw transcripts with identifiable data to GitHub.
- Cleaned transcripts should be saved to GitHub.
- Always use .gitignore to protect sensitive data.
