   - Published papers using spaCy
   - Recognized by research community
   - Can cite in methodology sections
   - Peer reviewers familiar with it

5. ✅ TRIBAL RESEARCH ETHICS
   - Local processing respects data sovereignty
   - No external data sharing
   - Can be audited (open source)
   - Respects Indigenous research protocols
   - Minimizes data extraction

6. ✅ PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
   - Easy to use (researchers can learn quickly)
   - Good documentation and tutorials
   - Active community support
   - Regular updates and maintenance
   - Works on standard hardware
   - Fast processing (important for large datasets)

7. ✅ ACCURACY FOR BUSINESS ENTITIES
   - Good at identifying organizations (ORG label)
   - Good at identifying locations (GPE label)
   - Good at identifying persons (PERSON label)
   - 85-90% accuracy (sufficient for research)
   - Can be fine-tuned if needed

================================================================================
WHY NOT THE ALTERNATIVES?
================================================================================

TRANSFORMERS (Hugging Face):
❌ More complex to explain in methodology
❌ Larger models (harder to reproduce exactly)
❌ May require GPU (not always available)
❌ Overkill for this use case
✅ Could use if highest accuracy is critical

NLTK:
❌ Lower accuracy (70-75%) - not sufficient for research quality
❌ Older approach (less credible for modern research)
❌ Rule-based (less reliable than ML-based)
✅ Good for learning NLP concepts

STANFORD NER:
❌ More complex setup (Java dependency)
❌ Less Python-friendly
❌ Harder to integrate
❌ Less actively maintained
✅ Good accuracy but spaCy is easier

CLOUD-BASED APIs (Google, AWS, etc.):
❌ Privacy concerns (data sent to external servers)
❌ Cost (may violate grant budget constraints)
❌ Not suitable for sensitive tribal data
❌ Reproducibility issues (API changes over time)
❌ Not appropriate for government-funded research

================================================================================
SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOUR PROJECT
================================================================================

MODEL CHOICE:
- en_core_web_sm (small): Good balance, ~12 MB, fast
- en_core_web_md (medium): Better accuracy, ~40 MB, still fast
- en_core_web_lg (large): Best accuracy, ~560 MB, slower

RECOMMENDATION: Start with en_core_web_md
- Better accuracy than small model
- Still manageable size
- Good for research quality
- Can upgrade to large if needed

INSTALLATION FOR RESEARCH:
```bash
# Install spaCy
pip install spacy

# Download medium English model
python -m spacy download en_core_web_md

# Verify installation
python -c "import spacy; nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_md'); print('✓ Installed')"
```

DOCUMENTATION FOR RESEARCH PAPERS:
- Library: "spaCy v3.x (Honnibal & Montani, 2020)"
- Model: "en_core_web_md (English pipeline, medium model)"
- Version: Specify exact version for reproducibility
- Citation: Include in methodology section

METHODOLOGY SECTION EXAMPLE:
"We used spaCy (v3.x), an open-source natural language processing library,
with the en_core_web_md pre-trained model for named entity recognition.
All processing was performed locally to ensure data privacy and comply with
tribal data sovereignty requirements. The model identifies persons, organizations,
and locations with approximately 85-90% accuracy on standard benchmarks."

================================================================================
INTEGRATION WITH YOUR CURRENT WORK
================================================================================

HYBRID APPROACH (RECOMMENDED):
1. Keep your current pattern matching (for speaker labels)
2. Add spaCy NER (for names/places in dialogue)
3. Combine results with validation
4. Best of both worlds: precision + recall

BENEFITS:
- Finds names in dialogue (spaCy)
- Validates speaker labels (your current approach)
- More comprehensive extraction
- Still maintains privacy (all local)
- Can explain both methods in methodology

CODE INTEGRATION:
```python
import spacy

class DeIdentifier:
    def __init__(self):
        # ... existing code ...
        try:
            self.nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_md")
            self.use_spacy = True
        except:
            self.use_spacy = False
    
    def extract_entities(self, text: str):
        """Extract entities using both methods."""
        entities = {
            "persons": [],
            "organizations": [],
            "locations": [],
            "tribes": []
        }
        
        # Method 1: Your current pattern matching (speaker labels)
        # ... existing code ...
        
        # Method 2: spaCy NER (dialogue content)
        if self.use_spacy:
            spacy_entities = self.extract_with_spacy(text)
            # Merge results
            entities["persons"].extend(spacy_entities["persons"])
            entities["organizations"].extend(spacy_entities["organizations"])
            entities["locations"].extend(spacy_entities["locations"])
        
        # Deduplicate and validate
        # ... existing validation code ...
        
        return entities
```
