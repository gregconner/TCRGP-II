Raw Transcript of Interview with Person_2 of Location_21 Among the Cornstalks
[A.1] Interviewer: All right, so welcome, good afternoon, now that it's 1, Location_15 time,
[A.2] Interviewer: My name is Jodi Brache. Organization_11. I'm also… and it's pictured here in, like, in, like, the back of my screen. Organization_21 here, but, our Pueblo is, is, comprised of six villages, and from the most western village, from the Siamma village. And so.
[A.3] Interviewer: That is me on Location_1 and Location_3 on my mom's side, and I'm Person_3, and a Location_10 and Siouxam on my dad's side. And so, that's what brings me here today. And so, getting a chance to think about
[A.4] Interviewer: what these students are, getting a chance to… to… to access, and looking at the different interviews and all these different types of data. It's really interesting. I didn't have access… this type of access until… until grad school, and so, it's wonderful that they're able to… to do these things now.
[B.1] Interviewee: That's great.
[A.5] Interviewer: Yes, most definitely. So, the first question that I have for you is, where is your cooperative located?
[B.2] Interviewee: We're located on Organization_9 in Location_19.
[A.6] Interviewer: Wonderful.
[A.7] Interviewer: See… and so what is the mission or the purpose of your cooperative?
[B.3] Interviewee: We are… Picking up our responsibilities, and making sure that we have a strong relationship with our seeds.
[B.4] Interviewee: And that we're creating an abundant
[B.5] Interviewee: Corn supply for our community and for the families that
[B.6] Interviewee: Want to have that connection and that relationship.
[A.8] Interviewer: Wonderful.
[A.9] Interviewer: That's really important.
[A.10] Interviewer: And so, before we go to the second question of when your cooperative was established, what is, if you can tell us about… a little bit about yourself, about who you are, and,
[A.11] Interviewer: Your role in the cooperative.
[B.7] Interviewee: Sure! So, I am Person_2, and I,
[B.8] Interviewee: had an experience, maybe about 11 years ago. I was out Location_8 at another tribal nation in Organization_1, and I was asking around where I could get some corn, and they sent me down the road to get corn from a white farmer.
[B.9] Interviewee: And I was just so taken aback by that, and I came home and told my mom, and that spring, we planted corn, because she just could not believe that.
[B.10] Interviewee: it had gotten to the point where we weren't even taking care of our responsibilities anymore. And in that time, we were experiencing a huge corn shortage in our community.
[B.11] Interviewee: So, really, we were only enjoying corn, you know, maybe at ceremonies, or special events, or, holidays, and so…
[B.12] Interviewee: We planted as a family that year, and we had a really hard time, really, we're on the struggle bus that year, and so we had almost a total failure of what we had planted.
[B.13] Interviewee: And so we got together with a whole bunch of other Organization_18 growers and Location_12 growers at the food,
[B.14] Interviewee: what was it, Organization_12 that was hosted here in Location_12? And we just called an impromptu meeting of corn growers, and we asked them, kind of like you are now, interviewed them, had a few questions prepared to see
[B.15] Interviewee: how are things going? You know, what kind of corn varieties are you growing? Are you having any issues? And what we heard from almost every grower in Location_12 was that everyone was struggling to grow corn with just their family.
[B.16] Interviewee: That it was just a big, labor burden. You know, having enough hands to take care of the corn was a struggle. Soil health was a big concern, and then everyone was growing in, like, small backyard plots, so the deer raccoons would come and wipe out the whole thing at one time.
[B.17] Interviewee: And people were really, you know, not feeling like things were going too well. And so, my mom and I, that fall, wrote a really small grant from Organization_3
[B.18] Interviewee: program, and we got a little bit of money, and we had a community event, like a workshop. We sent out postcards to all the, households in Location_12, and we had a workshop on white corn and soil health.
[B.19] Interviewee: And we had 75 people show up to that meeting, and so we were totally blown away by that, and then we asked if anybody wanted to stay behind after the meeting and talk about growing together the old way. And there was 10 families that stayed behind to have that conversation.
[B.20] Interviewee: And so, that was how we got started, was out of just kind of being curious and dipping a toe into planting, and then our failure, I think, was a lesson from the corn that, you know, we're really meant to be growing this together as a community.
[B.21] Interviewee: That it's not… it's a lot of work for one family to take on to grow, you know, corn, especially enough corn to sustain us and to save corn for the future.
[B.22] Interviewee: And so, my mom went to…
[B.23] Interviewee: Organization_7, and they set aside some land for us. That was our first barrier because, in Location_12, we have a lot of ag lands, we have thousands of acres of ag lands, but most of them are leased out to non-native farmers that grow conventional crops. And so, we were kind of a new anomaly for them. It was a bunch of Oneidas who wanted to grow Location_12 foods on Location_12 lands.
[B.24] Interviewee: And so they actually changed their policies for Location_12 families to have access to our ag lands on a free lease. So we got a free 5-year lease and started planting together. And that's how our co-op got started, was from… from all that effort.
[A.12] Interviewer: Wonderful. That is beautiful. You were seeing those various needs in your community of people needing to eat, and you're making it happen. That is wonderful.
[A.13] Interviewer: That is really important.
[A.14] Interviewer: And so, and you discussed, you know, our next question, when was your… well, you discussed what… what prompted it.
[A.15] Interviewer: When was that, when did you say, when was your cooperative established?
[B.25] Interviewee: So we're going into our 10th year, so our COP was established in [Year].
[B.26] Interviewee: That was kind of a, let's just try it and see how it goes kind of year. And, we didn't have enough seeds between us to plant an acre and a half of corn, so we wanted to grow.
[B.27] Interviewee: So, we struck up a deal with Organization_20, and we traded them wild rice for corn seeds.
[B.28] Interviewee: And that was really auspicious, because we… we were at another food summit in Location_22 when we did the trade, and we were kind of, you know, in the… off to the side in the parking lot, doing this little, like, side deal for corn and wild rice, and then that night, they had a moon ceremony, and they were saying how there was a prophecy that
[B.29] Interviewee: the, Location_8 and Location_7 would be trading again.
[B.30] Interviewee: And we were like, oh my gosh, we just did that! We just traded wild rice for corn seeds!
[A.16] Interviewer: Absolutely!
[B.31] Interviewee: Yeah, so that was awesome.
[A.17] Interviewer: like, clandestine thing, you were actually… this was something you were supposed to be doing, that's wonderful.
[B.32] Interviewee: Yeah.

[A.18] Interviewer: That's great. Was this the original vision? I mean, you wanted to, like… you saw this need, and that helped you with your original vision that brought the community, or how did… how did you envision that coming together with the community?
[B.33] Interviewee: I think that we, we were kind of feeding off of a model that we saw in Location_14.
[B.34] Interviewee: There's this beautiful marketplace in the city of Location_14 where there's 52 families from all these different indigenous communities, villages, and they bring all of their wares to this one store, and then each family takes one week, and they run the store for that week.
[B.35] Interviewee: So that they're only in the store for one week out of the year, and the rest of the year, they can do the things that they love, they can do the crafts that they want to create. And so we thought it would be so amazing to share, you know, this load, this labor of growing the corn together, and
[B.36] Interviewee: Create a system where we can, you know, put in maybe the same amount of time that we would in a backyard garden, but because we're all putting that effort into the same field, we could have this abundance of corn.
[B.37] Interviewee: And that's exactly what happened. Our first year, everybody came away with, I think it was 125 pounds of corn for their family.
[B.38] Interviewee: Which was a lot more than we had when we started. So that's what kept us going, was this idea that, okay, we're gonna work together, we're gonna… we're gonna commit our time together, and then hopefully, at some point, we'll have more than we need, and we'll be able to share it with the rest of the community.
[A.19] Interviewer: Wow, absolutely. That is just…
[A.20] Interviewer: That… so when you're thinking about, like, how you're pulling these things together, how did you identify community members to… to help you with this… with this work, this important work?
[B.39] Interviewee: We were really lucky that amongst those 10 initial families.
[B.40] Interviewee: We had somebody who was, trained in facilitation. We had somebody who knew, you know, the ins and outs of tribal offices to get access to the land. We had somebody who knew about equipment and how to go buy equipment from auctions. We had somebody who was really into soil health.
[B.41] Interviewee: So everybody had these gifts that we needed to operate already within that, like, initial group of 10 people. And then, as we started growing, we started inviting people to come under the wing of those families. And so,
[B.42] Interviewee: we would have a sort of a nomination process. We would nominate a new under-the-winger, and then we would all come to consensus, yeah, that person would be great to bring in, and they would spend a year sort of apprenticing with us to see, you know, do they jive with us? Do they…
[B.43] Interviewee: put in the time, you know, how are they… how is it to work with them? And for the most part, all of our under the wingers have become full members. So that's how our cooperative has grown. It's kind of by… through relationship, and through…
[B.44] Interviewee: Advocating for each other, and then keeping each other accountable.
[A.21] Interviewer: Absolutely. Wow, that's really important. Is that how you keep the community engaged? Because you had this startup, and so 10 years later, how do you keep the community engaged?
[B.45] Interviewee: That's an ongoing struggle, because there's so many competing priorities, and, you know, there's been babies that have been born, and things that have happened over the years, so it ebbs and flows, but we all make a commitment at the beginning of the year that we're going to work at least 50 hours.
[B.46] Interviewee: With the co-op.
[B.47] Interviewee: So, 50 hours with the hands on the corn, and then if you work any other hours, you know, to do all the administrative stuff, then those would be kind of counted separately, and then at the end of the season, we divide the harvest equitably based on how many hours were put into it.
[B.48] Interviewee: And so there's a lot of incentive for people to show up and put the time in, and then they have to meet that minimum threshold to maintain their membership in the co-op.
[B.49] Interviewee: And we've had some years where, you know, we've said, you know, this year was a really weird year, we don't have to, you know, stick to the 50-hour rule.
[B.50] Interviewee: Or, you know, a couple of years, we had, like, a total crop failure. So then, of course, there's no corn for people to take care of. But for the most part, people show up and they put their time in, and it's very much like, maybe you're just somebody who wants to pick corn.
[B.51] Interviewee: and you spend your whole 50 hours picking corn, that's totally fine. If you're somebody who likes to drive a tractor, you can do that. If you're somebody who likes to braid the corn, you can do that.
[B.52] Interviewee: So, it kind of allows people to put their time in where they're passionate and where they feel like their gifts are, and I think that helps us be successful because there's no, like, jobs within the co-op, it's all just kind of where you feel like your heart is within the co-op.
[A.22] Interviewer: Absolutely. Wow, that's really important. I mean, that's so, different than the way that people, like, envision, you know, like, a job, or like a… or, like, work and things like that. So that's really important that you're doing that.
[A.23] Interviewer: And so, some Native communities apply their cultural life ways and practices to inform the design of their cooperative. Is this what your community did?
[B.53] Interviewee: Yeah, I think we did, because, we make decisions based on consensus, which is our teaching from the Great Law.
[B.54] Interviewee: And we try to, make sure that everybody feels like they have an equal voice at the table.
[B.55] Interviewee: So, we… we really try to take into consideration everybody's perspectives. And then the other thing that we do is, the seeds are all taken care of by the women. So the women will do the seed selection, the seed, kind of guarding from year to year, and they'll let us know how much seeds that we have.
[B.56] Interviewee: And then the men typically tend to lean more towards, you know, prepping the fields and doing that kind of stuff, which is traditionally how we would have divided the labor, in the old ways, too. And there's a little bit of crossover. This year, we had four women who learned how to drive the tractor and how to operate all the equipment, so that was really neat.
[B.57] Interviewee: And of course, we like… the men are welcome at the table, too, so they get to make decisions along with us. But we're a pretty matrilineal society.
[B.58] Interviewee: And so, I think they're kind of used to the women calling the shots, and then they kind of follow what the women decide.
[A.24] Interviewer: Right.
[A.25] Interviewer: It's true.
[A.26] Interviewer: so different in, like, in, like, other… in, like, Western communities, you know, where that's, like, questioned, you know, so much of the time, like, why are they doing this or that, and…
[A.27] Interviewer: Your… your answer for that is… is wonderful. It's… it makes so much sense.
[A.28] Interviewer: Were there opportunities or challenges that the community identified as you were looking at these things where a cooperative would help improve or resolve, like, particular issues?
[B.59] Interviewee: Yeah, so, I think that the… the way that we spend time together and connect with each other was resolving, concern that we had in our community of not having a lot of opportunities to, like, really get to know each other and keep that strong community connection.
[B.60] Interviewee: And so, you know, we spend a thousand hours per acre of corn that we've planted.
[B.61] Interviewee: Sitting together, you know, we'll pick all of our corn by hand, and we put it in a big pile, and we sit in a circle, and we husk the corn.
[B.62] Interviewee: And it gives us an opportunity to get to know each other better, to share stories, and it's multi-generational, so, like, great-grandmas down to great-grandbabies, and so there's been a lot of intergenerational knowledge exchange through that, and it's, it all happens really naturally, like, people just kind of…
[B.63] Interviewee: Fill into these spaces, and these, like, really beautiful things just kind of come out of it without a lot of…
[B.64] Interviewee: Like…
[B.65] Interviewee: pre-planning or, like, trying to make it be a certain way. And when we did our SWOT analysis when we first started through our facilitation, there was a lot of concerns about,
[B.66] Interviewee: the young people not having access to those cultural teachings, and not… and not being sure how they were going to be perpetuating those. And so the kids that have grown up in the cooperative, because we've been going for 10 years now, now they're, like, writing their college essays about corn, and, like.
[B.67] Interviewee: getting up and speaking, and being really proud of who they are, and knowing where they come from, feeling that groundedness. And so I feel like we're, you know, resolving a lot of those things that we saw in our SWOT analysis as potential threats. We're addressing those with the work that we're doing.
[A.29] Interviewer: Wow, that's really important. People have a hard time, like, linking those, of, you know, seeing things, you know, like, reading things in, like, a book or something, but actually seeing those connections. That's wonderful that your community was able to do that, especially when people were able to, like, see it happen.
[A.30] Interviewer: That's… that's powerful.
[B.68] Interviewee: Yeah, and then, you know, we're really worried about people who don't have
[B.69] Interviewee: you know, any kind… a lot of people are moving back to Location_12 now that grew up in Location_11, they grew up in Location_13, because their families were part of that urban relocation program.

Page 3

[B.70] Interviewee: And so they didn't grow up with corn. And so when those people join our group, it's like a huge renaissance for them.
[B.71] Interviewee: to have that, things that they might have learned about the culture to be able to actually apply them and make them practical, instead of, sort of, you know, just spiritual, or just, like, this is how it used to be. And I think it's really important for us, like, I think of it as, like, we're rebuilding our village.
[A.31] Interviewer: B.
[B.72] Interviewee: Being the villagers that we've got to be to do that.
[A.32] Interviewer: Absolutely. It takes that mysticism away, you know, and it's like, this is the practical thing, you know, that we're doing, you know, we're growing corn, and so much of that mysticism.
[A.33] Interviewer: It's… it's wild how many people see that, you know, they see, like, natives in movies, or, you know, like, oh, say, this is, like, the stereotype that they believe, and it's just like, oh boy, it's so much more than that, and so it's just…
[A.34] Interviewer: So, how did your community learn about what a cooperative is? Like, you know that you wanted to do this for everyone, yet how did they learn about this?
[B.73] Interviewee: So, at the same time that I was, kind of traveling around out Location_8, I was working with, Organization_14 cooperative.
[B.74] Interviewee: And, they went through a process to get a grant and kind of do a pilot study, and I learned a lot about cooperatives by participating and supporting that work.
[B.75] Interviewee: And so, one of the advisors to that cooperative, we invited her up to one of our initial meetings. And she talked to us about different cooperative models and how different cooperatives work, and we just thought that really fits
[B.76] Interviewee: what we're trying to do. We're not trying to be a non-profit, necessarily. We're not trying to,
[B.77] Interviewee: really make any money at this, we're just trying to solve a problem together and have positive outcomes for everybody who contributes. So that's how we kind of landed on that cooperative model.
[A.35] Interviewer: Absolutely, that's huge. People, you know, they're thinking about how to make that happen, but they don't really know how they're going to do it. So, do your bylaws provide measures for distributing those profits?
[A.36] Interviewer: Do the members decide the dividend amounts and all of that?
[B.78] Interviewee: Yeah, so we… we don't have any profits, we just divide the corn. So the corn is our thing that we produce, and then, every springtime, once we have a full survey of how much we've harvested that year, we'll have a meeting about distribution.
[B.79] Interviewee: And a lot of times in that meeting, we'll say, oh, we gotta give some corn to this person who really helped us out, or we gotta… we're gonna set aside, you know, this…
[B.80] Interviewee: Last year, we did Organization_8, so we set aside about 1,700 pounds to process into the roasted corn mush flour. So, that came off the top, and then the rest of the corn was distributed by that sweat equity that was put in.
[B.81] Interviewee: So we have an honor system of recording our hours. So I'll say 2 hours picking corn, and then at the end of the year, I count up all my hours, and I…
[B.82] Interviewee: we plug them into a spreadsheet and figure out who did what, and made sure everybody got their 50 hours. So, it's pretty easy. We've never really had any issues with
[B.83] Interviewee: distribution or any conflicts around that. It was a really, straightforward thing. Everybody made, like, made sense to everybody, like, yeah, you should get out what you put in, kind of thing.
[B.84] Interviewee: So… and there's some people who do, like, my mom does…
[B.85] Interviewee: a thousand, two thousand hours a year. She's just always, always out there. And then, you know, some families, they'll… they'll get their 50 hours, like, okay, I'm good, I'm safe for the year. And we try not to make it, a guilt trip or anything like that. Like, we understand people have
[B.86] Interviewee: other things in their lives that they have to take care of and other priorities. But, we do try to be really
[B.87] Interviewee: communicative about what's available to do now. So, you know, in the spring there's planting, in the summer there's weeding, and then in the fall there's harvest. And there's always something to do, so we try to say, if you want to earn hours this week, we need this and this, and this is done. And that way people know where they can put their energy to kind of keep the momentum going.
[B.88] Interviewee: And that's been really helpful for people. And then the other thing we try to do is,
[B.89] Interviewee: break up the work into smaller pieces, because the first, year that we were growing, we were like, okay, you know, it's weeding time, and you'd show up with your hoe, and it's like an acre and a half of corn. You don't know where to start and where to end.
[B.90] Interviewee: So we created, like, a row adoption system. You could say, I'll take 3 rows or 5 rows, and we put little flags at the end of the row, so you know, okay, I'll start here, and then I'm done when I get to this part. And that was a really nice way to give people
[B.91] Interviewee: a piece of work to do, and so they don't feel responsible for the whole field, and then they also don't worry about if they're doing enough or not. It's all very straightforward.
[A.37] Interviewer: That's wonderful, that's great.
[A.38] Interviewer: And so, when you're…
[A.39] Interviewer: taking the corn, you know, out of the field, and you're putting it into, like, a building. Does, does your cooperative have, like, a building and or maintenance fund that you'd, like, draw from to do all the different things that you need to do?
[B.92] Interviewee: Yeah, so we do have a general fund. We rent a barn right now from one of our members, and the infrastructure that we have is very basic, so there's no plumbing.
[B.93] Interviewee: There's, like, barely enough electricity to plug in a couple of Nesco's to keep people fed. We have to get a porta-potty delivered every year. So one of our big, needs that we identified was, we need our own building. We need a place that has all the facilities for everything that we're trying to do, because by the time November rolls around, it's a lot less comfortable sitting in that barn asking corn.
[B.94] Interviewee: And a lot of people are getting older now, you know, they might have started at retirement age, and now it's 10 years later. So sitting in a cold barn really isn't appealing anymore.
[B.95] Interviewee: So, we did raise some money, and we're going to be building a building next year, and it'll have a little commercial kitchen in it, because one of the other needs that we identified was
[B.96] Interviewee: You know, we…
[B.97] Interviewee: if somebody gets 100 pounds of corn for their share, now what do they do? That's a slow food. You gotta figure out where you're gonna turn it into, how many, you know, how are you gonna nixamalize it with the hardwood ashes? Where's the grinder? How are you gonna grind this corn into flour? So, we had been renting…
[B.98] Interviewee: a commercial kitchen space within our casino, and then one of the catering kitchens, and that was a really good deal while it lasted, and then the tribe took over the management of the building, and we got kicked out. So we were like, okay, we have to be more self-sufficient. You know, it's nice to have the support from the nation when we can get it, but it's not always consistent.
[B.99] Interviewee: So we have to be a little bit more self-sufficient. And so we raised the money to build this building, and I'm really excited about it.
[B.100] Interviewee: So that'll be… they're finishing the design in the next month or so, and we'll be breaking ground in the spring. But that really came out of a need for, you know, needing space to host people, needing bathroom facilities so people can change their baby's diapers, needing a heated area that we can do work in in the winter, and then the other thing that we…
[B.101] Interviewee: we're trying to solve is this labor intensity of the corn, of needing 1,000 hours per acre. And what are the little pieces of equipment that we could get to help alleviate some of that, labor burden?
[B.102] Interviewee: So we bought a husking machine, we built a corn drying wagon this year, we got a sheller, we're just, we're starting to pull these pieces together, and we're trying to be really careful about
[B.103] Interviewee: The types of equipment that we get so that we're not damaging the corn, and we're not disrespecting the corn, because a lot of the farmers around us, they'll combine their corn.
[B.104] Interviewee: And there's just corn seeds flying all over the ground and all over the place, and we were like, that is not what we, you know, we can't do that. So we're trying to piece these pieces of equipment together and create this system that
[B.105] Interviewee: really treats the corn with respect, but then, you know, takes away some of that labor burden. So far, so good. So I'm hoping that it all works out, and this building comes together, and we can solve this problem, because Organization_4 asked us to grow 5 more acres of corn for the community.
[B.106] Interviewee: And we were like, we would love to do that, but we don't have 5,000 more hours just laying around. So hopefully with this equipment, we can start being one of those producers that puts corn through the Organization_19 to distribute it out to the community.
[A.40] Interviewer: Wow, that's wonderful. And to be called upon, people are seeing this, and they're like, oh, I know who to ask.
[A.41] Interviewer: Great.
[A.42] Interviewer: So, with all these different personalities, did your cooperative establish conflict resolution protocols as you created your bylaws, or how did you do that?
[B.107] Interviewee: Yeah, so, they say every cooperative needs a good therapist. So we've had our share of conflict, we've had our share of, you know, bumping heads, and we established a mediation protocol that

Page 4

[B.108] Interviewee: Really pulls from our traditional values of, calling on wise people to, advise us and try to resolve a conflict in a good way, in a peaceful way.
[B.109] Interviewee: And when that's not possible, people tend to step away when it just… there's too much for them, they don't… they can't get through the conflicts. We have had some families, step back from the cooperative, and, you know, we try to avoid that if possible, but it's not always possible, especially as we grow, you have more personalities interacting with each other. But I think that
[B.110] Interviewee: What we try to focus on in our meetings is all the good things that we do together.
[B.111] Interviewee: And even though we might have conflicts with each other, we're still producing this really beautiful thing, and in our ways, I'm sure it's… many other nations have this way, but you really have to have a good mind when you're around the food.
[B.112] Interviewee: And so, if you're angry in the cornfield, you have to excuse yourself. If you're angry in the barn, you have to excuse yourself. So I think it really keeps us
[B.113] Interviewee: And centered, to know what our boundaries and what our limits are, and to help, you know, resolve, whenever possible, those conflicts so that it doesn't poison that space around the corn.
[A.43] Interviewer: Absolutely. People say that in a similar way here, you know, about, like, oh, if, like, the chili's really hot or something, if they have, like,
[A.44] Interviewer: really hot chili stew or something, like, oh, they must have been, like, angry or something, you know, and it's just sort of like.
[A.45] Interviewer: Yeah, definitely.
[A.46] Interviewer: You know, that makes so much sense.
[A.47] Interviewer: And so, did your cooperative adapt or adopt standard cooperative development approaches?
[A.48] Interviewer: To meet the needs of your community?
[B.114] Interviewee: I think we… we followed some of the principles that aligned with our, cultural ways, but we think we followed more of our cultural protocols first, and
[B.115] Interviewee: Actually, so Person_4, one of our co-op members, she wrote a really beautiful article about that. She wrote a paper, a scientific paper about it, about how our protocols really inform how we work with the corn.
[B.116] Interviewee: And I think that, you know, we're all still learning. None of us are, like.
[B.117] Interviewee: All-knowing of our entire culture, And so, we try to honor
[B.118] Interviewee: Everybody's gift and their piece of the puzzle that they're bringing to the space, and every year we seem to learn another protocol, another teaching, another lesson that we need to treat the corn in a good way.
[A.49] Interviewer: So a lot of what we've been learning about is.
[B.119] Interviewee: The medicines that we soak the corn in, the protocols around… we started with our protocols of giving thanks.
[B.120] Interviewee: And having the tobacco burning and all those things for the corn, and then when we welcome people, visitors in, we'll have our, condolence edge of the woods ceremony to bring people in. So we… we try to follow our teachings first, and then a lot of times it ends up aligning with those cooperative principles. Just because it's…
[B.121] Interviewee: it's very similar, like, we want to work together well, we want to respect each other, we want to lift each other up, we want this to be mutually beneficial, we want to create harmony, and I think that's, you know, one of the biggest things is that harmony in the group.
[B.122] Interviewee: if there's that one thorn in the group that keeps poking and poking and poking, that's when we have to call in our mediation principles so that we can address that. So we just try to focus on that. And I think that…
[B.123] Interviewee: I would like to see an Indigenous cooperative, you know, principles developed at some point, because I think that the standard conventional co-op is a little bit more geared towards, like, making sure it's fair economically.
[B.124] Interviewee: And I think that's important, but I think what's more important is that we have good relationships, and we have strong, you know, bonds and community building through our co-ops. It's not really about, like, making sure everybody gets… gets something out of it, you know what I mean?
[A.50] Interviewer: Absolutely, that makes complete sense. I mean, it's just, you know, you have your community that's, where people have different gifts and different things that they're beating to the table, and so definitely utilizing that makes so much sense.
[A.51] Interviewer: So, with that, were there community resources, such as people, finances, partners, that were identified that you used to form the cooperative?
[B.125] Interviewee: Oh my gosh, yeah, we are a prime example of pulling every… every relationship, every possible, favor that we could call in to make it work, because, you know, we started with absolutely nothing. And so,
[B.126] Interviewee: It was really, the members of our co-op have a really strong, And positive,
[B.127] Interviewee: like, space in the community, like, they're very respected in the community, and so when they ask for something on our co-op's behalf, people tend to listen and respond. And so it was those many, many years, maybe even generations, of building that rapport and relationship.
[B.128] Interviewee: That allowed us to then call in some of those favors and ask for help when we needed it.
[B.129] Interviewee: So the first… layer of help we needed was land, and Organization_17 granted us some land.
[B.130] Interviewee: Then the second layer of assistance that we needed was equipment, and so we got, you know, some grants from the community and from outside the community to buy some pieces of equipment.
[B.131] Interviewee: And I think, advice, you know, getting advice on how to take care of our soil, and how to plant cover crops, and all of those things. And we're really lucky that we have some municipalities, not all, but some municipalities
[B.132] Interviewee: near Location_12 that are very, positive working relationships, so they help us out a lot with
[B.133] Interviewee: making sure that we have, you know, all the equipment, even if we end up borrowing it, to do the things that we need to do. Or one year we had to fill up our tank for our fish emulsion that we were going to spray on our field, and
[B.134] Interviewee: somebody in the community let us fill up our tank with their well. And so, you know, those are one of the instances where at distribution time, we're like, let's make sure this person gets some corn, because we would have been lost without them, you know?
[B.135] Interviewee: And so we try to keep it reciprocal. Anytime that something comes in the cooperative, we try to return that in corn, and really acknowledge the people that have helped us. And people have helped us at every single step along the way.
[B.136] Interviewee: And a lot of times, they're like, we don't really want to be part of this co-op, we just want to help you guys succeed. So we really try to appreciate those guys and show them some deference.
[A.52] Interviewer: Absolutely. That makes everything work, you know, just looking at what people are able to do, and that's wonderful.
[B.137] Interviewee: And we have… oh, sorry, go ahead.
[A.53] Interviewer: Oh, no, no, I was just saying that was beautiful.
[B.138] Interviewee: Oh, yeah, it is, it's, it's, like, when you step back and think about it, it's, like, kind of overwhelming sometimes, because it's just, like, so much love.
[B.139] Interviewee: But, yeah, we have a lot of our co-op members
[B.140] Interviewee: have, like, finance backgrounds now, and design background, and website building, and grant writing, and all of these gifts that they bring into the space. So, we've been really lucky that we've been operating without any paid labor. Everybody just earns their hours for the corn.
[B.141] Interviewee: And so, we create, like, little subcommittees, so there's, like, Organization_2 handles all the grants and the admin stuff.
[B.142] Interviewee: And there's a tech committee that handles, like, the website, and making t-shirts and stuff like that, and then there's the back acres that take care of the equipment and prepping the fields. And then there's the mouseketeers that make sure there's no mice in the barn, and then there's the corn stalkers go out and make sure that we know when green corn is ready, and which seed is going to be kept, and which seed is going to be put back in the food pile.
[B.143] Interviewee: So we kind of… we break it up by, like, little kind of committees or groups, and that seems to work really well, because everybody can just kind of join up with whatever committee they're interested in to help with all those different aspects.
[A.54] Interviewer: Absolutely, that's really important, you know, thinking about what they're able to do and all of that.
[A.55] Interviewer: And so, please share how you keep your community or Native leaders engaged and informed, because, you know, I mean, sometimes there's Native… excuse me, there's leaders that will go in there and, you know, say, pick up, be like a musketeer.
[A.56] Interviewer: Yet… but there's some that are… that are… that's not part of their… their gifting. How do you keep everybody engaged, especially leaders, Native leaders?

Page 5

[B.144] Interviewee: I think so for our elected leadership, we, try to keep them informed of everything that we're doing, and we have a lot of support and buy-in from our elected leadership, because,
[B.145] Interviewee: They see how much time and effort we put into the work that we do, and anytime they want to come out and do, leadership, you know.
[B.146] Interviewee: training, or team building, or anything like that. We always, you know, welcome them out, we'll feed them, we'll spend the day with them. So people know that we're kind of an open door. They can come out and spend time with us whenever they want, and we don't charge anybody for anything like that. We just… it's just relationship building for us. And so we've had, like, our clan managers came out.
[B.147] Interviewee: And spent a day of team building with us. We had our engineering team came out.
[B.148] Interviewee: We have elected leaderships, we'll kind of come in and out at our different events, so we try to keep a really open door. You know, it's not… it's not a secret club, anything like that, so, people feel pretty welcome. And then the other thing that we do is we set aside a share of our corn for,
[B.149] Interviewee: For funeral corn, so if somebody has a passing in their family, we gift them some corn so that they can prepare the meal.
[B.150] Interviewee: Because that's… that can be hard. If you don't grow corn, finding corn when you need it can be kind of hard around here. So we distribute that out to the community, so almost everybody in the community has received corn from us for that, and that has really…
[B.151] Interviewee: created a lot of goodwill, that we were there for them when they needed it. So that's… that's something that, you know, we… it was a small thing that we could do that would be important for people in our community.
[A.57] Interviewer: Absolutely, that's huge, you know, definitely thinking about all those different processes that people need, different, you know, like, corn for.
[A.58] Interviewer: And, whether they be, you know, like, religious and ceremonial and all of that, which is really important.
[B.152] Interviewee: Yeah, and we do have the, when the faith keepers ask us for corn, for green corn, you know, we just tell them to go help themselves at any corn that they need out there, anything like that. So, we try, you know, we don't… we believe that corn belongs to everybody.
[B.153] Interviewee: So we, you know, we don't never kick anybody out, or…
[B.154] Interviewee: you know, say, oh, no, this is our corn, anything like that. So, if somebody asks us, we're very, you know, willing to provide.
[A.59] Interviewer: Absolutely, that makes complete sense.
[A.60] Interviewer: And so, does your cooperative, see different… or do you see in your cooperative differences between your cooperative and others that you may know?
[A.61] Interviewer: Like…
[B.155] Interviewee: Yeah, I think we're… we're pretty informal.
[B.156] Interviewee: You know, we have monthly meetings to keep everybody up to date on what's going on, but we have a very, like, loose committee structure. We don't assign
[B.157] Interviewee: anything to anybody. People kind of hold themselves accountable, and then they work as they feel like they can, and they want to. And I think other co-ops have, like, staff, and they have
[B.158] Interviewee: Maybe, goals that they're trying to…
[B.159] Interviewee: you know, grow a certain amount, or make a certain amount, and I think that makes sense when you have staff, you have to have, you know, income coming in to take care of all those things, and that's what's made us, I think a little bit more informal and relationship-based, is there's no money, being exchanged.
[B.160] Interviewee: So there's no hard feelings or,
[B.161] Interviewee: Mis… you know, miscommunication around money is really easy. It's just not a part of our… of our,
[B.162] Interviewee: system at all, and I think that really helps us, stay grounded in what we're… what we're trying to do.
[A.62] Interviewer: Absolutely. That makes so much sense, because, you know, especially when you're thinking about what your cooperative does, and…
[A.63] Interviewer: How much,
[A.64] Interviewer: How much money does change things, you know, it's just, you wouldn't think that it was, you know, when you're initially working on something, but…
[A.65] Interviewer: It does…
[B.163] Interviewee: Oh yeah, it does, and not always for the better. Right. Yep.
[A.66] Interviewer: Absolutely. And so when you're thinking about your marketing strategy and, like, how you've let people know, did your… how did your cooperative develop a marketing strategy? Did you, like…
[A.67] Interviewer: How did you do it?
[B.164] Interviewee: We didn't. We really didn't. We…
[B.165] Interviewee: Well, the first few years, we really were only growing enough corn for our families.
[B.166] Interviewee: And then maybe some families would have extra corn, and they might sell it to the Organization_19?
[B.167] Interviewee: Or they might barter it. We've done a lot of bartering with our corn.
[B.168] Interviewee: You know, we created a Facebook page, and then we have a website that just directs you back to the Facebook page. But I think it's a lot of, word of mouth, and every year we have our, Person_5, the harvest moon.
[B.169] Interviewee: And so, we invite the whole… everybody in the world can come to that. So we put out, you know, our flyers and the gullybi socks in our newspaper, and then we invite, you know, anybody and everybody that we know to come to Location_12 and
[B.170] Interviewee: participate with us, and it's a huge celebration, and so people just kind of learned about us through that, I think, through coming to our events, through hearing us talk on different things. I think we've been on a couple different
[B.171] Interviewee: presentations, we've been on, like, PBS and stuff like that. So, I think people just kind of, you know, word of mouth, or by coming themselves, have learned about us. And then, the first market that we entered was Organization_8.
[B.172] Interviewee: And really, the only reason we went into it was because it was so culturally aligned with what we were doing.
[B.173] Interviewee: So, we were like, wow, an opportunity to put food into this program that's gonna get it out to tribal elders all over Location_19. We would love to be a part of that. So, we were part of that for 3 years, and so we would decide how much of our distribution would go into it, and then sometimes after that.
[B.174] Interviewee: families would get their distribution, and they would bring their corn together and put in another order to tribal all their food box. So…
[B.175] Interviewee: We didn't really have to market for that. In fact, I think they approached us, or we knew someone who was helping establish that program.
[B.176] Interviewee: And we had to really ramp up to do that, because we didn't have…
[B.177] Interviewee: an oven to roast the corn. We didn't have a grinder to grind the corn, so we, again, pulled on all of our resources to make that happen. And that's the only product that we've ever produced, is that roasted corn mush flour, and really only for Organization_16 program.
[B.178] Interviewee: And then the only other market that we would sell to would be the Organization_19. And so when we put together our plan for this big building, we had to identify, like, who are our markets and all this stuff, and we reached out to,
[B.179] Interviewee: Awamni restaurant in Location_16, and a couple of other tribal organizations to see who would be interested in buying corn from us down the road when we have a lot more, and there was a lot of interest.
[B.180] Interviewee: So, I think that, you know, that might be something that we become interested in at some point, but I think we're pretty far away from that, and I think it would only happen if it felt right.
[B.181] Interviewee: It's not a goal of ours, necessarily, to sell corn to just anybody on the street.
[B.182] Interviewee: I think we're really focused on, like, the meaning behind it, the relationship, and then our people having access to those foods.

Page 6

[A.68] Interviewer: Absolutely. That makes so much sense.
[A.69] Interviewer: So, with that, you know, with, you know, going with the other, or, you know.
[A.70] Interviewer: Would you call that, like, a form of, like, cross-marketing if, like, they were to put, their product amongst your corn, and then your corn amongst their products? Like, like another entity? Like, another, that business that you're speaking of?
[B.183] Interviewee: Yeah, or like, Person_6 up at Location_2, and Person_7.
[B.184] Interviewee: He sells wild rice, and he's interested in bartering wild rice for us with corn.
[B.185] Interviewee: So we would send him the dehydrated hominy, and he would probably pack it up in his packaging, his, Spirit Lake packaging, and sell it through there, but I think that would be an awesome trade. I've, like, really been trying to ramp up to get to the point where I'm like, alright, Person_6, I'm ready, I got 100 pounds of dehigh, let's do this trade.
[A.71] Interviewer: Absolutely, there's so much potential there, and just, you know, so many different things. I mean, I'm not a farmer, nor do I do, like, any sort of marketing, anything of that sort, but I mean, it just sounds like it'd be, like, a really good partnership, and it would be, like, a lucrative partnership on both ends as well.
[A.72] Interviewer: You know, and, like, the needs that you need in your… in your home communities and all of that.
[B.186] Interviewee: Yeah, and when we, when we had… so during the pandemic, we had,
[B.187] Interviewee: A small grant that allowed us to donate
[B.188] Interviewee: I think it was a thousand… a thousand pounds of corn to, the Location_12 pantry.
[B.189] Interviewee: And so we, dropped it off at the cannery, the cannery processed it, and then it went to the pantry. So then the label said, grown by Person_8, processed by Organization_19, and then it went out to the community. So that's another, you know, opportunity is to just kind of share a little bit of our story through other
[B.190] Interviewee: Other, you know, processors that have a lot more capacity than we do.
[A.73] Interviewer: Absolutely. Wow, that's really interesting.
[A.74] Interviewer: And so, thinking about all of that, does your cooperative offer ongoing education and training to its members, to the community?
[A.75] Interviewer: And your boarding staff, and all of that?
[B.191] Interviewee: Yeah, we try to. So anytime there's an opportunity, a webinar, or a conference, or anything like that, we try to, provide those opportunities to our membership.
[B.192] Interviewee: And so, usually, we have a really small travel budget that we can send people to different places. We don't have it right now because everything's going into this building. But this year, we went to Organization_13 at Organization_5.
[B.193] Interviewee: And then we also went to the green corn dance with Organization_22, and we did a demonstration with them, and made some corn husk flowers with them. That was absolutely beautiful.
[B.194] Interviewee: Just being part of their green corn dance, and
[B.195] Interviewee: I think those… those opportunities, like, we go to Person_9 every year up on Madeline Island.
[B.196] Interviewee: with Anishinaabe, and we always bring corn soup up there with us to feed people while we're up there. So we try to, you know, especially if we get chances to go out Location_8 to our homelands, we try to get people out there and do those kinds of exchanges, because we learn so much.
[B.197] Interviewee: from other people. Every time we get together with other tribal nations around corn, we learn so much.
[B.198] Interviewee: And when I was in… I was invited to, like, an international Indigenous corn
[B.199] Interviewee: symposium in Location_20, in Location_5, and I, was so honored to go there and share a little bit about our story. And I met these two women from Location_25, and I was telling them I always wanted to go to Location_25, and they invited us to do cultural exchange with them.
[B.200] Interviewee: So we brought 20 Oneidas, which is not how many Oneidas I thought we were gonna bring. It was a lot of people.
[B.201] Interviewee: down there, and we rented a big bus, and we went from village to village, and we did cultural exchange for, like, two and a half weeks. So we have a lot of, really beautiful opportunities. We did the same thing with the Maori in Location_23 in New Zealand. They invited us out, and they have…
[B.202] Interviewee: Indigenous organic verification program that they developed.
[B.203] Interviewee: And it's all based on their cosmology and their worldview. So they took the organic standards, adapted it into an indigenous model, and it's like a mentorship program, a 3-year mentorship program. And then at the end, you kind of graduate, and then your community comes out and verifies you.
[B.204] Interviewee: So, an inspector doesn't come to your farm to write you some certificate of certification, your community signs your verification.
[B.205] Interviewee: And so, it was really beautiful to go. We went to multiple farms out there to see, you know, all the beautiful food that they're growing and connect with them, and…
[B.206] Interviewee: Those kinds of experiences really keep us going, because it feels like we're part of this bigger movement and story for, like, this resurgence of Indigenous foods and Indigenous life ways.
[A.76] Interviewer: Wow, that's… that's really… that's really important. I mean, it's really just, you know,
[A.77] Interviewer: there's just so much there. There's just so much there. So you were mentioning with, like, your workshops and the different things that you're doing to provide, like, ongoing education, and people coming in to, like, verify what you're doing. Does that include, like, cooking classes and all of that?
[B.207] Interviewee: We want to do cooking classes when we get our kitchen. Yeah, definitely. Yeah.
[A.78] Interviewer: Wonderful. Okay.
[A.79] Interviewer: That sounds definitely good, and definitely tasty. I'm thinking, I want some corn now, but, you know. Yeah, I know, it's hard to talk about corn for an hour and not get hungry. It's true. It's wild.
[A.80] Interviewer: And so, do you… well, is your plan when you're offering these cooking classes, are you going to do them virtually as well as in person, or…
[A.81] Interviewer: One or the other? What is your plan?
[B.208] Interviewee: I think we'll probably do them in person. I mean, we'll have this brand new facility, so I think it'd be really nice to do them in person. I think it'd be really nice to, especially around the green corn, not a lot of people get to enjoy green corn.
[B.209] Interviewee: Just because it's, like, either you're going to ceremonies and you're having green corn, or you're not. And so, I think that getting people more in touch with all the different things you can do with corn, all the different foods that we can make.
[B.210] Interviewee: is going to be really important, and having people see, like, you know, to get green corn, you have to plant the corn first, so…
[B.211] Interviewee: That's what my mom started telling people, because she has… she makes a really good corn soup, and people are always asking for her corn soup recipe, and she's always like, well, first you have to plant a seed.
[A.82] Interviewer: Absolutely, that's a vital part of, yeah, partaking in any part of it, you're right.
[A.83] Interviewer: And so, with that, does your cooperative engage in inter-cooperative collaboration with other cooperatives?
[A.84] Interviewer: And so, say there could be, like, a… like, a really good cook, you know, like, over on the other side, you know, that,
[A.85] Interviewer: is, you know, familiar with preparing corn? Are they…
[A.86] Interviewer: Do you… do you collaborate with them in any way?
[B.212] Interviewee: wanted to. This year, we wanted to do that. We thought our building was going to be done this year. That was hilarious. It was never going to happen this year. But we had planned on doing a green corn
[B.213] Interviewee: gathering with chefs from multiple different tribal nations to share their green corn recipes with each other, and then to do, like, taste testing with the people that come to the gathering. So that's definitely something that we want to do, because that…

Page 7

[B.214] Interviewee: knowing how to prepare the foods is the next level for us. We're getting pretty good at growing the corn now, but not everybody in our group knows how to prepare the foods once the corn is ready. And I feel like we're in the same boat. If you have a bunch of corn and you don't know how to cook it.
[B.215] Interviewee: you're not really any farther down the road than you were when you didn't have a lot of corn, so… that's the next big thing that we're going to be working on, is making sure everybody at least knows the basics, and people know how to make the roasted corn mush flour now pretty good. You know, you just gotta roast it and then grind it, so it's just two steps. I think people are a little bit more intimidated by the nixtamalization process.
[B.216] Interviewee: Or even knowing when green corn is ready and how to select for green corn.
[B.217] Interviewee: So those will be the things that we can get into, and we're really lucky around here, we have lots of Indigenous chefs, and so we would, yeah, it would be so awesome to bring them in and, have, like, a really down-to-earth kind of, you know.
[B.218] Interviewee: Cooking class for people, for families to learn how to prepare these foods into some really yummy dishes.
[A.87] Interviewer: Absolutely. Boy, that sounds good.
[A.88] Interviewer: So, thinking about the community, how does… how do you think the community interacts with… with the co-op? Because we've been talking about how the co-op interacts with the community, but…
[A.89] Interviewer: So how do you think the community sees the co-op?
[B.219] Interviewee: We get a lot of positive, feedback from people in the community who,
[B.220] Interviewee: They are really glad to see
[B.221] Interviewee: People in the community creating a space that is community-run, that isn't reliant on tribal resources, and that is separate from, sort of, tribal oversight, so that it can kind of have its own say over how things go, and… and, like, a lot of the work that we do is
[B.222] Interviewee: After hours and on the evenings and things like that when tribal offices would be closed. So they're really grateful that, you know, they can come in the evenings and the weekends and spend time with us.
[B.223] Interviewee: And then I think a lot of people come to our events, whether that's in the spring or at harvest time, and they just see the barn totally full of corn, and it's just like, you see their eyes light up. So we get a lot of…
[B.224] Interviewee: People that are, like, really encouraging us to keep going, really, you know, maybe not ready to take the step into growing corn themselves, but really, giving us a good push to keep going.
[B.225] Interviewee: And this year, we, put a call out, because we had a crazy…
[B.226] Interviewee: Spring, and we planted, the cranes ate all our corn, so then we had to plant again, but there was…
[B.227] Interviewee: the rows weren't lined up, so then our rows were, like, all over the place, so we couldn't use our equipment to weed, so we had to hand weed again. And so, we were just falling behind on hand weeding. We put a call out to the community, we had, like, 25 people show up and help us weed for 2 hours, and it was like, boom, done, you know? It was just incredible.
[B.228] Interviewee: So, I think it's, really shows the people are in support of what we're doing, and they're willing to kind of roll their sleeves up when we call for their help.
[B.229] Interviewee: And it just… everywhere I go, I only hear good things. And I… I know there's not… I know there's people who have bad things to say about us, because there's always going to be people like that. But I think it's just jealousy. You know, I think that, I think a lot of people have…
[B.230] Interviewee: talked about doing something like this, but to actually do it is another thing, and I think that we can kind of get…
[B.231] Interviewee: It's almost like we're stepping on other people's toes by being successful, is how it feels sometimes.
[B.232] Interviewee: And so, we try not to engage with that, because it's just like, well.
[B.233] Interviewee: We're just growing food. It's not… it's not an act of war.
[A.90] Interviewer: Right, absolutely. No, that is a great way to go about doing it. Just, you know, getting things done, and you're right, there's always going to be naysayers, you know, like, across the board, and
[A.91] Interviewer: Always. In every community, it's like that.
[B.234] Interviewee: Yep.
[A.92] Interviewer: And so you mentioned previously about the way that you, like, shifted. Well, I mean, you didn't necessarily say shifted, but, I mean, the ways that your community, that your cooperative.
[A.93] Interviewer: worked with this global pandemic of, say, COVID-19. And so, do you think that that… that global pandemic
Person_1, like, the entire makeup of your cooperative?
[B.235] Interviewee: Hmm… I think it reminded us…
[B.236] Interviewee: That we, were carrying a really important responsibility.
[B.237] Interviewee: And that our teachings talk about
[B.238] Interviewee: There being a time when there's no food.
[B.239] Interviewee: And they talk about needing to put food away.
[B.240] Interviewee: We're supposed to have 7 years of food put away for that time.
[B.241] Interviewee: And they, you know, the prophecy's pretty dark. Like, it's not gonna be good. And so, we believe that. And so, I think a lot of what we experienced during the pandemic with the shortages and the shutdowns and the distribution systems breaking down, the whole chain broke down.
[B.242] Interviewee: It was another one of those reminders, just like that first government shutdown, like a decade ago or whatever, when there was… there were nations that didn't have any… totally cut off from Location_17 and had no food coming in. That, I think, is what sparked the food sovereignty movement.
[B.243] Interviewee: I mean, maybe there was an ember there, but that really gave it some oxygen, and I think that a lot of people woke up and realized we have to be self-sufficient. If not self-sufficient, co-reliant.
[B.244] Interviewee: We have to be able to count on each other and take care of each other. And I think that the pandemic was a big reminder to us that that's what we're supposed to be doing. Like, our original instructions and our responsibilities as people are to each other and to the earth and to the seeds and all the beings that take care of us.
[B.245] Interviewee: It's not a responsibility to the economy, it's not a responsibility to all of these things that distract us. That's our core responsibility as Ungwehue, as Indigenous people. And so I think that is a… that was a good reminder, and this last shutdown was another good reminder.
[B.246] Interviewee: Because, again, pantries' shelves were going bare, and people weren't able to eat. And so it just keeps us…
[B.247] Interviewee: You know, really focused on what our responsibilities are and what our core mission is, so we don't get
[B.248] Interviewee: confused, because we're human, we need reminding all the time. That's why, like, our ceremonial cycle, they say the same things every year, because we forget. Our human memories are not that strong, you know?
[B.249] Interviewee: So, I think that's… that's… those are important reminders for us to… to stay focused.
[A.94] Interviewer: Absolutely. Powerful and important reminders, that is exactly right.
[A.95] Interviewer: And so, do you feel like this… this, belief and everything, is this what makes your cooperative successful? Or what do you think makes your cooperative successful?
[B.250] Interviewee: I think it's the people.
[B.251] Interviewee: There's… Really good people, with really big hearts, who really, really care.
[B.252] Interviewee: And, We just try to take care of each other and lift each other up.
[B.253] Interviewee: And I think that's what makes us successful. We don't…

[B.254] Interviewee: you know, get it twisted, we don't… there's nobody in the group who wants to take credit for anything… everything. There's nobody in the group putting anybody else down. It's a safe space.
[B.255] Interviewee: And it's hard to find a safe space like that.
[B.256] Interviewee: you know, we really don't tolerate any nonsense. And so, I think that that's what keeps us going, is that people know they can come, and it'll be safe, and they can have good feelings, and
[B.257] Interviewee: leave feeling really positive about themselves and their community, and that we're, like, sharing this greater purpose. We have this greater purpose of growing corn for our community.
[B.258] Interviewee: And I think if we got off track with that, we might fall apart, you know what I mean? Because it's a precarious thing to be entirely reliant on people deciding to put their time into something.
[B.259] Interviewee: And so, we have to make sure that when they do that, it's a good experience for them.
[A.96] Interviewer: Absolutely
[A.97] Interviewer: How does climate change impact in your community, like, impacting your co-op and the services that your cooperative provides?
[B.260] Interviewee: It has been rough. We've seen 3 years of failure due to spring floods in the past 10 years.
[B.261] Interviewee: And so, we've really put a heavy focus on rebuilding our soils.
[B.262] Interviewee: And taking care of our waters. So we have, buffer strips around all the waterways. We have a 6-year rotational cover crop plan, so that, 4 years of cover crops never… the soil is never disturbed.
[B.263] Interviewee: And then we'll plant an annual, and then we'll plant a cover crop into that, or corn into that. So we're really trying to rehabilitate our soil from…
[B.264] Interviewee: You know, deforestation, and then conventional industrial agriculture practices that have really destroyed our soil.
[B.265] Interviewee: We're… we're aware that we're, like, racing the clock.
[B.266] Interviewee: To… to regenerate the soil, to be resilient in the face of all these changes.
[A.98] Interviewer: Absolutely. I mean, we can see those changes happening for sure. I was just having a conversation about this, just a few days ago, just thinking about… because about our snowfall here in Location_24 and in Location_15, we don't have… we had one day of snowfall.
[A.99] Interviewer: And just looking back upon, like, pictures from before, even when this picture behind me was taken of our Pueblo and all of that, I mean.
[A.100] Interviewer: this was just last year and the year before that we had so much more, but this year, every other day is, like, sunny and dry. I think it's almost in the 70s now, and so, like, the summers are…
[A.101] Interviewer: are ridiculously hot, you know, it's like… it's just… it's just wild how much, you know, we can see this happening, and… you know, I think about my daughter and, like, our future generations who are going to be dealing with all of these things, and…
[A.102] Interviewer: And it freaks me out. It freaks me out so much, and just thinking about all of this, that this is going to be part of their daily life, that it's going to be not only warmer, but it's going to be significantly warmer. And so, just all of those different aspects of, like, climate change, you know, just are impacting us in so many ways.
[B.267] Interviewee: Yeah, and that's… I don't know if you guys have, teachings about that change that's gonna come, too, but that's…
[B.268] Interviewee: you know, we've been told about this for a really long time, so I try to remember that it's…
[B.269] Interviewee: this is gonna happen, and we have our, like, our teachings of what we're supposed to be doing, and the closer we can listen to that and enact that, the better off we'll be, because, you know, it's gonna… it's gonna be hard. It's gonna be really hard.
[A.103] Interviewer: Right.
[A.104] Interviewer: It will be.
[A.105] Interviewer: It's definitely… and one of, the other…
[A.106] Interviewer: discussions, we're just talking about all these different aspects of, like, climate change and how that's impacting all these cooperatives and…
[A.107] Interviewer: And those are definitely things that, you know, were… they were thought about in previous, conversations, but not thought about. I mean, like, this is… this is happening fast, and just how much of a change there was from, like, last year to this year, it just… it is wild. And so, it makes us, you know, really think about…
[A.108] Interviewer: How we look to the future.
[A.109] Interviewer: Is the impact that you want your cooperative, is this something that you want your cooperative to tackle? And if so, like, how do you… how is that going to look for your cooperative and for the community?
[B.270] Interviewee: Yeah, so one of the things that came up, and I'm so sorry, I have to run in a couple minutes, but, one of the things that came up in our building design was that our members wanted a green barn.
[B.271] Interviewee: So we got a grant to do agrivoltaics. So we're going to be putting solar panels up in our field and growing food under those solar panels, and that's going to power the whole building, so that we can at least have sort of a net neutral impact with our building.
[A.110] Interviewer: That's huge. That is definitely huge. Well, thank you, Person_2. Thank you so much for spending this time, because I know that, like, this is really important. There was one of the other people that we spoke to a few weeks ago who was talking to us from the fields, like, you could see the fields behind him, and there's just so much of the work that needs to get done.
[A.111] Interviewer: And so I definitely am thankful for you taking this time to talk with me, and that, you know, like, there's so many people are going to, like, learn from your examples, from the different things that you've shared, and we will send all of this, you know, back to you, and so, you know, that you can see this, and…
[A.112] Interviewer: And be part of this entire learning process, so thank you.
[B.272] Interviewee: I really appreciate you all reaching out and
[B.273] Interviewee: allowing us to be part of it. I know it's such important work, and there's so much work to do, but there's so many great people who are doing it. And so I try to remember that, that, like, we're just one little piece of the puzzle, and we can only work on what we can work on, and we have to count on everybody else doing their part, too. And a lot of people are, and it keeps me going.
[B.274] Interviewee: So thank you for your work on this, I really appreciate it.
[A.113] Interviewer: Absolutely. Well, take care of yourself, and I will talk to you soon.
[B.275] Interviewee: Okay, sounds good. Nice to meet you.
Person_1 to you, take care.
[B.276] Interviewee: Bye.
