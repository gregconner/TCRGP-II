[A.1] Interviewer: And just thank you for taking the time to be with us so we can learn about the work that you do, and just a little bit of conversation I had with you. I was really excited about
[A.2] Interviewer: how you're such an advocate for your communities, and so proud of your Location_24 culture. So, thank you for being with us.
[B.1] Interviewee: Thank you.
[B.2] Interviewee: So I just wanted to start off, by saying that I'm not a technical person.
[B.3] Interviewee: So, I really hope that I can ask you guys to give me some grace. If there are technical questions and I'm not able to answer them immediately, that you would give me, you know, half hour or so to email you the answer.
[B.4] Interviewee: Because we have, you know, engineering and operations, and I have a bunch of people that I can ask if I don't have an answer to a technical question.
[C.1] Interviewer: Absolutely, yes, that sounds good. I don't think any of us are really, we just pick things up as we go, and so…
[C.2] Interviewer: if we're using different types of, like, different types of technology, we've just, you know, we're like, oh, okay, and COVID forced us to, like, use these things, and so this is where we are.
[C.3] Interviewer: But we're just, you know, wanting to learn from you, to learn about your experiences working with this co-op, and any information that you find that would be, pertinent to what we're working with, that would be wonderful.
[C.4] Interviewer: That's okay.
[C.5] Interviewer: So, I mean, the project description, which I believe you've received previously, yet, what we're doing is building research capacity, and we're inviting tribal college students. So, we want to definitely involve students, Location_11 students and other Indigenous students as we go along.
[C.6] Interviewer: to be involved in the research process, to have access to both qualitative and quantitative data, which I didn't have until grad school, so it was just sort of, I mean, like, for the students to have this opportunity now, it is just wonderful that they're able to do
[C.7] Interviewer: to do some of these different things and have this access. And so, that's what we're working on. So we can, go through these questions. I put them here on your screen. Are you able to see them?
[B.5] Interviewee: I have them… I have a Word document up, because I… I, spent a couple of days… well, a couple of evenings making sure that I had some good bullet points to be able to answer these questions.
[C.8] Interviewer: Wonderful! Okay, then I will close this window, and so it's just, you and I looking at the…
[C.9] Interviewer: And the information here. Let me pull this up.
[C.10] Interviewer: finish here… Talk about technology.
[C.11] Interviewer: And just getting things on the right side. Okay, so,
[C.12] Interviewer: Well, I'm from, the Location_12. I,
[C.13] Interviewer: grew up… well, part of the time on Location_27 Reservation there in southern Location_8, and then the other part of the time here in Location_17. And so, getting a chance to be… to move home, it took a little while, took about, a few years, you know, to get here, but… but now I'm here. And just, you know, the different things, that there's so much…
[C.14] Interviewer: wisdom and so much knowledge that is included here that, just being… I feel like I learned something brand new from the people around me, and so it's just… it's just great, and I learn every day.
[C.15] Interviewer: So that's why, you know, we're extremely excited, so thank you for taking this time to meet with us, to talk about, you know, the things that are going on with this cooperative, and then your… and then your role in all of it. That's exciting.
[B.6] Interviewee: I just got back from Location_21, Location_26, Tuesday.
[C.16] Interviewer: Okay.
[B.7] Interviewee: I spent my 55th birthday down there.
[B.8] Interviewee: They've completed.
[C.17] Interviewer: birthday.
[B.9] Interviewee: words.
[C.18] Interviewer: Wonderful.
[B.10] Interviewee: I love Location_8. I love the heat. Anyway… Yeah.
[C.19] Interviewer: Well, wonderful, I'm glad. I'm glad you had a good experience. Yep, Location_8 is, you know, there's so many different things going on there, so many temperatures, you know, like in Northern Location_8, like, the Location_44 area. And then you go south, and it's, like, desert area, and it's warm, and it's arid, and all those different things.
[C.20] Interviewer: So, there's so much there, for sure.
[C.21] Interviewer: Well, wonderful. Well, the first question, if you are able to…
[C.22] Interviewer: To help with this one, where is your cooperative located, and what is the purpose of your cooperative?
[B.11] Interviewee: So, AVAC serves 58 rural communities. Ends up being about 60-some tribes, And…
[B.12] Interviewee: We were first established in [Year], and then, in 67,
[B.13] Interviewee: and we started providing electricity, I'm sorry, I just panicked there for a second, to remote
[B.14] Interviewee: 3 remote communities that didn't have any electricity. None.
[B.15] Interviewee: So, and that was, Location_20, Location_15, and… Location_30.
[B.16] Interviewee: And so, if you… if you look at the map of Location_41,
[B.17] Interviewee: we have 229 federally recognized tribes, but if you look at the map of Location_41, AVAC's service area goes all the way to Location_43 in the Northwest Arctic.
[B.18] Interviewee: it… and then all the way down to Yak… Location_30.
[B.19] Interviewee: On Kodiak Island, so that's closer to the chain. We have Location_23, which is southeast Location_41, and then way over west, Location_7, and then east, Location_2. And Location_2 is the only community that is served
[B.20] Interviewee: by a road. Everything else
[B.21] Interviewee: is served by barge or airplane. And when I'm talking airplane, I'm talking, like, a 737 into a hub community, like Location_3.
[B.22] Interviewee: And it serves 56 communities surrounding it, and so you're able to get in and out with a single engine or a twin-engine, airplane. That's it. I mean, they, you know, it's rea… Location_41's really, really unique that way.
[B.23] Interviewee: So,
[B.24] Interviewee: to answer… I just wanted to give you, like, a little 30,000-foot overview of how… of… of our territory. I mean, it's… it's huge. You cut Location_41 into thirds, and it would make Location_36 the fourth largest state.
[B.25] Interviewee: So, I mean, it's just, you know, it's massive. So,
[B.26] Interviewee: You know, as we go down this… down the questions, you know, logistics is an issue, because everything has to be imported.

Page 2

[B.27] Interviewee: But yeah, anyway, so we wanted to… AVAC's mission is to, you know, our founding purpose is to improve living conditions and support community development and, be able to teach,
[B.28] Interviewee: community members how… some skills on how to, you know, for distribution, and for power plant maintenance, and, you know, those kinds of things, and then just enhance the quality of life. I do want to just mention one thing, and I'll try to keep all my other answers shorter.
[B.29] Interviewee: we… we have a book of letters from 5th and 6th and 7th graders from Imanguk. It's… Imanoc, I don't know how to… E-M-M-O-N-A-K,
[B.30] Interviewee: And in [Year], these kids wrote AVAC a letter about… letters about how excited they were to get electricity and the things that they were gonna do.
[B.31] Interviewee: Just having a light bulb.
[B.32] Interviewee: having, a radio, having… I mean, just the… the cutest things, and then these, a lot of the names of these kids ended up being
[B.33] Interviewee: Location_41 state leaders, like, one of them is the superintendent for the school district out there. Another one, Person_4.
[B.34] Interviewee: Was the first… was part of a lawsuit that create… that made sure that schools were built in all of the villages, and they weren't
[B.35] Interviewee: importing all of the… all of the villagers, to, you know, Chimaua, or Edgecombe, or, you know, all of the other boarding schools. And so, it's really… it's really sort of neat how new Location_41 is,
[B.36] Interviewee: For everything, because, you know, late 60s, early 70s, to get electrified is pretty new.
Person_2, okay.
[B.37] Interviewee: Sorry, Person_3, I'll try to keep my answers shorter.
[C.23] Interviewer: That is…
[C.24] Interviewer: No, that is great background information, you know, especially with thinking about how, you know, quickly people have access to, like, electricity now. That's huge, that's a huge and important point, you know, that people are not aware of, and they're not, you know, when they think of Location_41, they don't… they just think of, like.
[C.25] Interviewer: they might think of, like, Location_39 or something of that sort, but they don't know. Or they might think of Location_19, but they might not think about, like, everything else, you know, that is involved into that. And so that is a great point of talking about, you know, like, electricity.
[C.26] Interviewer: Something that many of us take for granted.
[B.38] Interviewee: Right?
[C.27] Interviewer: Absolutely. Which leads us to the next question. What is your role or position in the cooperative? I mean, I know that you mentioned some of it, but if you want to mention some more of it, that'd be great.
[B.39] Interviewee: So, I'm the community relations person for AVAC,
[B.40] Interviewee: for our 58 communities, and
[B.41] Interviewee: So I just build and maintain relationships with the leaders. So, Organization_8 are unique in that they have three governing entities. One is the city government, right?
[B.42] Interviewee: And then the next is the tribe, and then the next is the village corporation. There's also regional corporations, but just in each community. The village corporation is the landowner, and I know that that's different than Lower 48.
[B.43] Interviewee: where the tribe is the landowner. In Location_41, it's the corporation, the village corporation, or the regional corporation. So, my job is to make sure that I know
[B.44] Interviewee: all of the board members and council members, and that we get their buy-in, because when we do a project, or we're redoing a project, we often have to get site control, and so that's, that's one of my jobs. But,
[B.45] Interviewee: you know, the other thing is just, oftentimes these communities, if you go… when you visit them, it's often, like, going backwards, like, 75, 100 years, and I…
[B.46] Interviewee: I say that really carefully, but as an Location_41, you know, Indigenous person,
[B.47] Interviewee: it is true, you know, and then Location_24, which is my culture, and, like, English is my second language, you know, started learning English when I went to kindergarten. But,
[B.48] Interviewee: in my area, meetings are conducted in Location_24. Location_24 is the second most commonly spoken language in Location_41.
[B.49] Interviewee: And it's the only Indigenous language in the
[B.50] Interviewee: Location_6, that is the second most commonly spoken language. It is spoken. But there's lots, all kinds of different cultures here. Location_37.
[B.51] Interviewee: There's several different kinds of, Indian, Location_18, Haida, deny…
[B.52] Interviewee: you know, but there's a lot of what is more commonly referred to as Eskimos, Location_37, Location_24.
[B.53] Interviewee: Jupik, you know, Ali, you know, there's all different kinds of Indigenous culture… cultures here. But, my job is… and there… and each region is, like.
[B.54] Interviewee: politics are touchy and undefined and regionally specific, and my job is to make sure that we, I'm communicating and translating what all of the engineers and the operations department, is wanting and needing from the community, but also
[B.55] Interviewee: Explaining the project, and then being able to come back to all of these engineers and explaining what the community's needs are.
[B.56] Interviewee: and what their goals are, and, you know, if they oppose a project, the reasons why. So at, you know, that's…
[B.57] Interviewee: That's my job.
[C.28] Interviewer: That's definitely huge. That is a… that is a huge job that, you know.
[C.29] Interviewer: definitely making something, you know, like, the information accessible to people. Like, you mentioned, like, the engineers who, might understand, like, these certain things, but they do not understand all of, like, the background information, and so I'm so glad that you are able to
[C.30] Interviewer: to help them with that information, with that background information, for sure. And you have a lot of, you know, long-term background knowledge that other people don't have.
[C.31] Interviewer: And that's just important. You can't put a price on that or anything, and that's really important.
[B.58] Interviewee: Yeah.
[B.59] Interviewee: It is. It's, you know, rural Location_41 is very different, and so when you're not used to
[B.60] Interviewee: I mean, it's a huge learning curve when people come here and try to do a project in rural Location_41, because, you know, if it's grant fund… publicly funded, or whatever, you know, all of these engineers go in and are like, we're trying to do something nice for you.
[B.61] Interviewee: But they're getting some pushback, and so the first blush is that they're difficult to work with. No, they live there, they're appreciative of new infrastructure, but they have some concerns.
[B.62] Interviewee: What we do… We have a lot of fuel.
[B.63] Interviewee: When we work on a community tank farm.
[B.64] Interviewee: There… there are some issues there, and they are right… they have a right to be concerned about those kinds of things, where they're placed.
[B.65] Interviewee: the long-term, you know, effects of… of having a tank farm sit there in a power plant, sit there for the last 50, 60 years. What… what's going on with the soil there, right? And, you know, so…
[B.66] Interviewee: Yeah, anyway.

Page 3

[C.32] Interviewer: Absolutely, that's definitely important information that, you know, isn't always included. You know, it's just sort of like these, like.
[C.33] Interviewer: caveats about this and that, and it's like, well, no, like, that's… that's important information that makes, you know, Organization_17 and that makes other organizations come together. Most definitely. And that… that's actually a great segue to thinking about our next question. What brought the community together to start the cooperative?
[C.34] Interviewer: For the original vision of the co-op.
[B.67] Interviewee: Well, there was an elect… there was not electricity in rural Location_41, so Governor Person_5 sort of got some leaders together, and… and,
[B.68] Interviewee: created this task force, I guess, on how to solve this problem. And so, you know, in the 60s,
[B.69] Interviewee: late 60s, when AVAC, you know, started working on this and became a cooperative, they visited other Organization_17, they met with the community leaders.
[B.70] Interviewee: Because, you know, BIA… some BIA schools in rural Location_41 had electricity, but that was it.
[B.71] Interviewee: And, you know, maybe some stores had their own generators, but they were real limited, on when they would, run them, right?
[B.72] Interviewee: And so… We… AVAC got loans from,
[B.73] Interviewee: from RUS, Organization_21, and REA. Oh, let me…
[B.74] Interviewee: I didn't… I'm blanking on REA, Organization_11… let me… let me make sure that I have that right.
[B.75] Interviewee: Organization_6. Okay, I should have wrote that one down. Thank you for that. And…
[B.76] Interviewee: it would… they got a [Financial_Amount] loan that… and they were able to build generation plants and… and then tank farms, because in rural Location_41, you have… everything is run on diesel. We're not going to get away from diesel for a long time, because our communities are so far spread apart, and they're…
[B.77] Interviewee: you know, might… they're a microgrid. There are some communities that have, you know, an inner tie if they're close, but for the majority of our communities, they're all little microgrids. And it's… we have some pictures, it's real cute, of how
[B.78] Interviewee: we would send in a generator, and that was the power plant, and the whole community came, would come, and they would drag it on skids on the snow to where the new power plant would be. I mean, every… you know, it was that exciting.
[B.79] Interviewee: But yeah, that's how AVAC was started.
[B.80] Interviewee: And then the cooperative model was chosen,
[B.81] Interviewee: Because of how we could accept federal funding
[B.82] Interviewee: And those kinds of things, because we rely heavily on, on, on grants.
[B.83] Interviewee: For new construction in rural Location_41.
[B.84] Interviewee: Does that answer the question?
[C.35] Interviewer: It definitely does. Sorry, I was trying to, like, unmute myself. And yes, it definitely answers the question, and it provides, like, some of that background information that, you know, that we're certainly looking for as part of, you know, looking at how these different, how your particular cooperative came together.
[C.36] Interviewer: And it,
[C.37] Interviewer: you know, like, thinking of our next question, has your culture influenced the design of the cooperative? Much of that, you definitely, included some of that as part of your initial answer. I'm wondering if you could, you know, answer some more of that. How has your culture influenced the design of the cooperative?
[B.85] Interviewee: Well, I mean, I wasn't around when it was first, you know, started, but…
[B.86] Interviewee: And AVAC is not tribally owned, even though our members, our owners of the cooperative, are 90-some percent.
Person_2, you know, Organization_3.
[B.87] Interviewee: We are not tribally owned, so we don't have,
[B.88] Interviewee: Tribal hiring preferences, or those kinds of things.
[B.89] Interviewee: But…
[B.90] Interviewee: as a cooperative, and just being part of Location_41, and having to come up with solutions that are very unique to anywhere else in the world, we share a lot of traditional,
[B.91] Interviewee: values, and, you know, we do that by just how we communicate and how we work with… with each, of the… our communities. Our… our community… each community has, a delegate.
[B.92] Interviewee: And a chairperson, and they host an annual meeting in each one of their communities.
[B.93] Interviewee: And then, once they do that, it,
[B.94] Interviewee: the delegate is… comes to Location_39 for the big annual meeting.
[B.95] Interviewee: Where all of the delegates from, our communities come in with our board of directors to meet. And so there… there's shared… there's just communication. What are the major issues in your community? What are the major goals?
[B.96] Interviewee: And then just a lot of education on our part.
[B.97] Interviewee: Communicating with the, you know, the community. But… but there's a lot of mutual support, so those are the kinds of things that, you know, we share, with… with our traditional,
[B.98] Interviewee: member owners.
[B.99] Interviewee: But yeah, I just needed to make that distinction that we're not tribally owned, even though I wish we were. We're not tribally owned, and… you know what I mean?
[C.38] Interviewer: Absolutely. I wish we were.
[C.39] Interviewer: That is a huge discussion, you know, definitely thinking about when tribes exercise their sovereignty and what that means.
[C.40] Interviewer: Because it means something different for each tribe, each community, and…
[C.41] Interviewer: thinking about what that would look like, you know, those are definite conversations that are… that are swirling around that people are having, especially with this government shutdown. So thinking about all those different dynamics and thinking about what that would actually look like tomorrow.
[C.42] Interviewer: Or this afternoon, you know, like, what that would actually look like.
[C.43] Interviewer: And so, yeah. So, how did your cooperative members learn about the cooperative? Like, how did they learn about the work you do, the important work you do?
[B.100] Interviewee: Like, today, or when we started?
[C.44] Interviewer: Both, actually. Any sort of, like, when it was initially started, and then maybe if, like.
[C.45] Interviewer: It's taken a turn with, like, social media, things of that sort.
[B.101] Interviewee: because later on, you have a marketing question, so I don't want to answer that. But… so early AVAC leaders, you know, working

Page 4

[B.102] Interviewee: With state partners, and others, visited all of our… those three communities that we started out with, and, visited other Organization_17.
[B.103] Interviewee: And… and those models, but…
[B.104] Interviewee: because we're in Location_41, and because you can't drive to these communities, AVEC had to adapt the traditional cooperative model through our EA, or Organization_6.
[B.105] Interviewee: But we relied on technical and, and, and, and financial,
[B.106] Interviewee: guidance, I guess, from state and federal agencies and other Organization_17. And then now, you know,
[B.107] Interviewee: because we do get new… new communities occasionally, since I've been here for 16 years, and
[B.108] Interviewee: And let's see, I mean…
[B.109] Interviewee: we've… we've probably… we've had at least a handful of new communi… I'm looking back at the map. We've had a handful of new communities join. The cooperative model really works. The community that I'm from, Location_42.
[B.110] Interviewee: which is, about 400 miles, west of Location_39, is not part of the… a cooperative,
[B.111] Interviewee: But… but if you look at our… at the AVAC cooperative, and look at communities surrounding our communities, you'll see that our rates are really, really good.
[B.112] Interviewee: That's one thing that the cooperative does. Even though
[B.113] Interviewee: we're, you know, 3, 4 times more expensive and more than the lower 48. I mean, we have one… we have a couple communities where we're flying in fuel at
[B.114] Interviewee: You know, sometimes [Financial_Amount] a gallon, and their electricity rates are over a dollar a kilowatt.
[B.115] Interviewee: In most of our communities, they're about 60 cents.
[B.116] Interviewee: it's really expensive to do business in rural Location_41. Fortunately, we have power cost equalization, so at least at, you know, your private home or a public facility, you can be eligible for
[B.117] Interviewee: for that subsidy that… that then reduces the cost, and… and equalizes it to… to what the road system, pays, or what I pay here in Location_39, which is… it ends up being, you know, 26 cents a kilowatt.
[B.118] Interviewee: Ish, but that makes it a little bit more affordable.
[B.119] Interviewee: And then later, I'll talk about, like, how…
[B.120] Interviewee: how we reach our communities, unless you want me to do that now.
[C.46] Interviewer: Sure, then I will just, you know, we won't talk about that later. That'd be completely fine.
[B.121] Interviewee: Okay, so… I'm gonna go down to my notes. So, we don't…
[B.122] Interviewee: like, I was a little stumped on this question, because
[B.123] Interviewee: We don't do traditional marketing, like, you know.
[B.124] Interviewee: like, maybe, someone like you guys might do, because we're the… we're the only option for electricity in our communities. There's no other option. There's no inner ties. These communities aren't connected by road or… or anything else, so when you're… when you want electricity.
[B.125] Interviewee: and you're in one of AVAC's communities, AVAC's the option. So, you know what I mean? So, it just makes marketing a little bit different. But we do have… we are part of, the Rural Light.
[B.126] Interviewee: we get… we get a certain amount of pages every month.
[B.127] Interviewee: And so do other Organization_17 in Location_41 and around… I'm sure you've… you know about the Rural Light, no? Anyway,
[B.128] Interviewee: Yeah, so we get a certain amount of pages, and
[B.129] Interviewee: So… so when our… I'm a member of the cooperative. I have an account in Location_3, I have a place in Location_3, which is a AVAC community, but we get these
[B.130] Interviewee: the rural light, and we're able to highlight specific things about Location_41. The majority of it is, you know.
[B.131] Interviewee: Organization_17 from, you know, the entire country. And then the back page, Person_6, our president and CEO, is able to address our membership
[B.132] Interviewee: every month by writing a letter. And then, one of the things that
[B.133] Interviewee: is unique, I believe, is that we use Facebook a lot. Rural Location_41 seems to, utilize Facebook
[B.134] Interviewee: more than anyone else. And one of the reasons is because, cell phones
[B.135] Interviewee: if you're sending a picture, or… or just, you know, some self… cell phones just sometimes don't work in villages, but…
[B.136] Interviewee: you can always send a picture via Facebook Messenger. And I don't know exactly why that is,
[B.137] Interviewee: But, we utilize Facebook a lot, so whenever we have a scheduled outage, or even an unplanned one, or we're doing projects, we put on our Facebook page, these notifications, and that seems to get the word out. In addition to, you know.
[B.138] Interviewee: posting in a community. And then we have community meetings, we publish news that, the world… we don't publish it. We submit articles and stuff, and it does get published and mailed out. But we also publish and distribute annual reports.
[B.139] Interviewee: And then, in the communities.
[B.140] Interviewee: We just have a really good relationship with the tribes, the cities, and the corporations. And the… one of the best things that, the best ways to get the word out is to have them post a flyer at the post office, the city, the school, you know.
[B.141] Interviewee: the community building, the washateria, and that… and that has worked successfully for us.
[C.47] Interviewer: That is wonderful. Who would have thought? You know, like, Facebook, you know, it's one of those things where it,
[C.48] Interviewer: keeps people, you know, in touch with one another, and it also communicates important information, like you're saying. Who would have thought, you know, like, years ago, that Facebook would serve that type of purpose, but it… it does, and I'm sure, like, the creators of Facebook
[C.49] Interviewer: Maybe they had that as part of their plan, who knows? I mean, I don't… it's just funny, you know, just thinking about Facebook and, things of that sort.
[C.50] Interviewer: And so…
[C.51] Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that information. That's really important, you know, information that isn't necessarily thought of, especially, you know, people just think of, social media and just like, oh, let me just hop on social media, but they don't find it as, like.
[C.52] Interviewer: One of the main sources
[C.53] Interviewer: potentially, like, the only source of information, especially if you're, like, in very rural communities where, like, they might not have, some cell phone tire… excuse me, some cell phone towers to, to… to communicate those different things. So that is… that is important information. Thank you for sharing that.
[C.54] Interviewer: And that makes me, you know,
[C.55] Interviewer: So our next question, did your cooperative adapt or adopt standard cooperative development approaches to meet the needs of… I mean, it sounds like you did, at least with, like, the social media part and, like, connecting with the people that need, you know, the electricity, but I'm sure you've done other things.

[B.142] Interviewee: Yeah, we've… we've adopted the cooperative, governance structure.
[B.143] Interviewee: But we have to adapt, because Location_41's so unique and so spread… so spread out.
[B.144] Interviewee: We… we train local residents because we rely on
[B.145] Interviewee: On power plant operators to run the, the, the,
[B.146] Interviewee: The power plant day-to-day, and so we have power plant operators and alternate power plant operators.
[B.147] Interviewee: Because they, you know, they need to go check the power plant 3 times a day, at a minimum, early morning and midday and late at night, and fill day tanks and those kinds of things, and then routine maintenance.
[B.148] Interviewee: And then, we often have, agreements with the city, governments To hire and, and,
[B.149] Interviewee: and to hire and then manage the power plant operators, but we do also employ directly power plant operators ourselves. When a city says, we're just not going to do this anymore, we need help,
[B.150] Interviewee: we'll… we'll go ahead and… and hire them directly. But if they're hired by the city, then we just pay them, monthly, plus a little bit extra for, administrative fees and,
[B.151] Interviewee: And they're able to watch the power plant operator day to day. But we do have a power plant operator supervisor here that's in contact with them all the time. But that's 58 communities, you know, serving… and we serve 60 communities through InnerTies, but…
[B.152] Interviewee: it's a lot to manage.
[B.153] Interviewee: And then, you know, we're unique in that
[B.154] Interviewee: We have independent microgrids, so it's just, you know, it's… Yeah, it…
[B.155] Interviewee: it's just so different. And then, you know, because we're based, our administration is based in Location_39, we're able to share, services, so we have a small, tight.
[B.156] Interviewee: accounting office. Our… our department, does all new construction and key accounts. We have
[B.157] Interviewee: you know, engineering that is small and tight, and then operations. You know, we have a handful of linemen, a handful of mechanics, a handful of trainers, a handful of wind technicians that go out
[B.158] Interviewee: That are always out going to our communities.
[B.159] Interviewee: Yeah, and then… and then I just… one final… I'm looking at my, my bullet points. I want to make sure that, you know, the… the board is elected by its members.
[B.160] Interviewee: And then, you know, management and operational staff are paid employees. I wanted to make that
[B.161] Interviewee: because we… that is exactly like the cooperative governance, right? We have a seven-member board,
[B.162] Interviewee: And they're all, members. And then the other thing is, is that, you know.
[B.163] Interviewee: most of our employees are not cooperative members, because we're here in Location_39, and Location_39 isn't an AVAC community. So that's, you know, unique. I think I might be the only employee
[B.164] Interviewee: that is… that has a… that is a member of AVAC that has an electricity account.
[B.165] Interviewee: I could be wrong, but I think I… I think it's…
[B.166] Interviewee: That was true from a couple of years ago, at least.
[C.56] Interviewer: Right.
[C.57] Interviewer: That… that's really interesting in thinking about all those different dynamics. Thank you for sharing that.
[C.58] Interviewer: For sure. And so you were talking about, you know, you know, people having these different types of,
[C.59] Interviewer: You know, access and information, like, they're having these different roles.
[C.60] Interviewer: So how do you keep tribal, tribal leaders involved in all of this? All these different changes, which I'm sure that they're aware, but how do you keep them involved?
[B.167] Interviewee: Well, I mean, just communication.
[B.168] Interviewee: When… When our maintenance guys and wind technicians and linemen, and others are in a community.
[B.169] Interviewee: they reach out to the leadership. You know, these communities are pretty small, like, 100 people. I think Location_29 was our largest at 1,000, but now that we have Location_3, you know, that's like 6,000 people.
[B.170] Interviewee: you know, Location_23 has, like, 800… I mean, these are real, pretty small communities, and so it's easy to get the word out. A lot of our communities still rely on, VHF,
[B.171] Interviewee: Radio?
[B.172] Interviewee: And so, you know, you can just go and make an announcement on VHF, everybody will hear it on that channel if they're inside their home or in a… in a
[B.173] Interviewee: You know, in a building somewhere.
Person_2, Person_3, what was your question again?
[C.61] Interviewer: it was about how you keep tribal members engaged, and the reason why I'm asking that is because, you know, down here in the Location_12, and then, like, other,
[C.62] Interviewer: all these other tribes, part of the lower 48, are, you know, thinking about, you know, there's a lot of people that are looking to their tribal leaders, you know, to be… to be leaders. You know, to really, you know, to be up to date on, like, what's going on in their communities, and…
[C.63] Interviewer: So I'm wondering if that's the same for your community.
[C.64] Interviewer: And how you…
[B.174] Interviewee: But we, equally, the city government, the tribal government, the tribal government usually is the social arm, and then the village corporation
[B.175] Interviewee: is the for-profit, you know, arm. We communicate with the leadership of all three entities.
[B.176] Interviewee: so, it's not primarily the tribe, but when we're looking for money.
[B.177] Interviewee: we work with the entity that is the most eligible. Oftentimes, it's us, but, you know, there…
[B.178] Interviewee: before this administration, there really was a focus on tribal energy money through, Organization_10, Indian Energy, you know.
[B.179] Interviewee: So… so…
[B.180] Interviewee: But we always, even if we're, like, even if we're working with just, like, the city for, like, a community development block grant to upgrade a community to three-phase,
[B.181] Interviewee: and other things to be able to accept renewable energy in the future, or whatever. Even though we're working with the city as the… as the grant applicant, we do all the work.

Page 6

[B.182] Interviewee: From, you know, grant application to construction to grant reporting for the community, but we work very tightly with them. But we always include
[B.183] Interviewee: We always copy, or carbon copy, the tribe and the village corporation, and oftentimes the regional corporation, or the regional entities as well.
[B.184] Interviewee: Because they all work so closely together.
[B.185] Interviewee: yeah, I think that answers your question.
[C.65] Interviewer: Absolutely, you know, because
[C.66] Interviewer: As we're thinking about these things, are members of the cooperative eligible to serve on the board, or…
[C.67] Interviewer: Okay, are you able to explain that?
[B.186] Interviewee: Yeah, they're elected, you have to be a member of…
[B.187] Interviewee: AVAC to even run for the board, and board members are elected by the members.
[B.188] Interviewee: of APAC.
[C.68] Interviewer: That is definitely important, and thinking about, you know, how people feel, you know, like, this is, like, their ownership. They're like, okay, let me make some good decisions, especially when this is part of, like, this is impacting me and, like, my family, and so that's really important to think about.
[C.69] Interviewer: You know, and definitely thinking about tribal leaders, and thinking about, you know, everyone who's a part of this process. It's just,
[C.70] Interviewer: It is wild, so…
[C.71] Interviewer: Are there members that are, volunteer, or are they paid? Or, I mean, and I don't need to know, like, the dollar amount, but just how are they… how do they have these different roles?
[B.189] Interviewee: the… the…
[B.190] Interviewee: the AVAC board? Correct. Or, like, the… like, in each community, like, the chair and the delegate and the… or…
[B.191] Interviewee: Could you expand on that question, please?
[C.72] Interviewer: Correct. So, I'm asking if, like, the people that are involved in these Organization_17, if they, if they're, like, on a volunteer basis, or they're being paid to do this?
[C.73] Interviewer: How does that work?
[B.192] Interviewee: Yeah, the… like, the board, gets a stipend for, you know, their meetings, and then the community leadership,
[B.193] Interviewee: whoever is elected, the community chairperson, and then the delegate, they get a very small meeting fee, to coordinate the meeting, and then our office, Organization_2, sends them, you know, all of the material. It's a… it's a huge
[B.194] Interviewee: huge endeavor.
[B.195] Interviewee: every year, I… all of the boxes that, you know, Organization_2 has to send out, they send out door prizes and those kinds of things, but it takes… they… they send out a big box to every chairman, and then help them coordinate a meeting,
[B.196] Interviewee: you know, to try to… to try to get, membership to… to participate so that, you know, they're eligible to send a delegate to the… the big annual meeting in… in… in Location_39.
[B.197] Interviewee: I mean, it's a huge, you know, it's… those roles are… they're… I mean, they're mostly volunteer, because that… their… their only duty is to… to get… to ensure a community meeting every year, but they are compensated a tiny bit.
[B.198] Interviewee: I wish we could compensate them more, but for all of the members, There's no compensation.
[B.199] Interviewee: You know, we just… We really try to make electricity affordable and consistent.
[B.200] Interviewee: And then our office here, we, you know, we take care of, you know, the PCE payments and the billing and, you know, all of that, so…
[C.74] Interviewer: Thank you for answering that. Yes, that's really important information, especially when we're thinking about, you know, how people have these certain roles, and they…
[C.75] Interviewer: you know, what they do to, like, maintain them, but just like you mentioned, you know, like, making electricity affordable and things of that… of that type, because I'm just thinking about, like, the cost of,
[C.76] Interviewer: You know, things within stores, you know, that we've seen, like, okay, so, like, a loaf of bread is, like.
[C.77] Interviewer: I don't know, [Financial_Amount] or something. Where over here, like, it's… it's not [Financial_Amount] it's, like, [Financial_Amount] or [Financial_Amount] but… but still, you know, just thinking about some of those, some of those different things, you know, and thinking about…
[C.78] Interviewer: You know, whether people are, you know, just like you said, like you said, whether or not they're, they receive a stipend or things of that sort, which is… which is really important in just thinking about all those different dynamics.
[C.79] Interviewer: And as you've mentioned, you know, many of these different things, you've discussed, like, the marketing plans, you've discussed issues that, like, your… the cooperative, you know, like, it targets and it works towards making it,
[C.80] Interviewer: You know, solving different problems if, like, people see these things as, like, a problem.
[C.81] Interviewer: And working towards that, which is really important, especially when we're thinking about, like.
[C.82] Interviewer: Things such as, like, electricity and… and things of that sort, which, you know, people can't, generate themselves unless they are creating, like, their own…
[C.83] Interviewer: wind turbines, or water turbines, like, whatever it is. And so, but you, some people aren't able to do those types of things, so this is really important thinking about
[C.84] Interviewer: Those different needs that it fulfills, that it serves, and then all of it.
[C.85] Interviewer: So in the future, are there… well, in the currently and in the future, are there issues in the community that… that your cooperative intends to… intends to help?
[B.201] Interviewee: Yeah, you know, the funding climate has really changed.
[B.202] Interviewee: and… It's sort of cr… You know, and then climate change.
[B.203] Interviewee: The tundra is melting,
[B.204] Interviewee: just… we've had… we just went through a really huge storm in western Location_41, and… and just the other day, Cox of View, which is a hub for
[B.205] Interviewee: the communities in the Northwest Arctic region.
[B.206] Interviewee: Their runway was completely under. Everyone… it was mandatory evacuation.
[B.207] Interviewee: the jet… the Organization_20 jet couldn't land in Location_33 for days. In Location_16, they had an evacuation there because they're right on the Bering Sea, and so the whole coastline
[B.208] Interviewee: western Location_41 suffered from a really huge storm where Where, the tide…
[B.209] Interviewee: The tides went up, you know.
[B.210] Interviewee: I… I think it was 10 feet or something, and now we're expecting another one on Sunday.

Page 7

[B.211] Interviewee: That… You know, combined with
[B.212] Interviewee: funding not being available like it has been. We don't have Senator Person_7 anymore with earmarks for Location_41.
[B.213] Interviewee: So, you know.
[B.214] Interviewee: all of these things combined, it's really… I mean, it really… it's really creating the perfect storm, honestly, that things are going to have to change, and communities are going to have to start contributing towards projects.
[B.215] Interviewee: And that is going… that's going to be, you know, scary, and it's going to be, it's going to be a huge learning curve for communities.
[B.216] Interviewee: because, you know, we have communities that are literally sinking.
[B.217] Interviewee: When you build on tundra, if you're not building with
[B.218] Interviewee: You know, thermal… thermal siphons.
[B.219] Interviewee: Keeping the ground frozen with pile, you can have entire tank farms and their tanks toppling over, at spring break, or during these 100-year storms that are happening every year.
[B.220] Interviewee: And where the, you know, the permafrost is melting, and existing infrastructure, homes, and, you know, those kinds of things, you always are having to,
[B.221] Interviewee: What is it called when you,
[B.222] Interviewee: re-level, when you level a house. That's an… that's a thing here. It's always been a thing, but it is more so now.
[B.223] Interviewee: But I… I wanted to say that, but I wanted to be real specific, too. We've had a… we do a, because we collaborate with our communities, we,
[B.224] Interviewee: we have a couple of really good success stories. One of them is… is Location_32 and Location_40, in western Location_41. They're… it's around, Unile Cleet area.
[B.225] Interviewee: So about, you know, 550 miles sort of northwest of Location_39.
[B.226] Interviewee: they… they got all new infrastructure. They happened to be connected by an existing road, but we were able to build a brand new co-located and shared power plant to serve both communities.
[B.227] Interviewee: And then build the community a tank farm, AVAC a new tank farm, build an 11-mile inner tie, and then with
[B.228] Interviewee: In cooperation with Location_32 and Location_40, we built a 900 kilowatt wind turbine there. We have recovered heat. We're working right now on… in Location_32, we're working on now wind to heat.
[B.229] Interviewee: That should be done soon for Location_40's water and sewer projects, because, you know, water and sewer is huge, and when you're… when all of your pipes are built above ground, and it's super cold, and you're using
[B.230] Interviewee: you know, 30,000 gallons a month of diesel to keep those pipes from freezing. Having recovered heat.
[B.231] Interviewee: or wind to heat from the power plant or wind turbines is so beneficial for these communities. Helps to, you know, lower their water and sewer bills, or it can. I mean, we don't dictate that, we just like to be able to provide it, but
[B.232] Interviewee: I wanted to note Location_32 and Location_40 because they're unique in that Location_32 contributed
Person_2 contributed [Financial_Amount] and Location_40 contributed [Financial_Amount] towards that.
[B.233] Interviewee: It ended up being, like, [Financial_Amount].5 million project to install that… that… that 900 kilowatt turbine.
[B.234] Interviewee: And now, that turbine reduces diesel consumption by 105,000 gallons a year.
[B.235] Interviewee: And,
[B.236] Interviewee: When you're looking at, you know, a delivered price of fuel for us, we, you know, we buy 9 million gallons
[B.237] Interviewee: Of… of diesel a year, so our… our rate is, you know, about [Financial_Amount] [Financial_Amount] in… [Financial_Amount].5 dollars or so in… in Location_32, where the community, when they order their fuel, they're, you know, they're paying probably [Financial_Amount] or [Financial_Amount].
[B.238] Interviewee: dollars a gallon for gas and diesel.
[B.239] Interviewee: But it's saving the community… both communities, a ton of money, and
[B.240] Interviewee: Yeah, so, I mean, those are… that's one really good example, but that's how we have to work within every one of our communities. And then, because the pots of money have gotten smaller, we ended up, you know, getting money from
[B.241] Interviewee: DOE, Organization_10, Organization_1, which is, a federal
Person_2 in the state that, has invested
[B.242] Interviewee: over [Financial_Amount] worth of energy-related projects over the decades.
[B.243] Interviewee: And they continued to do so. And then…
[B.244] Interviewee: we actually had some FEMA money from another, community that we were able to, forrest Button, our… the manager of… of special projects and… and… and Key Accounts, was able to… to, use in Location_32.
[B.245] Interviewee: For… for the VIN project, to be able to come up with that [Financial_Amount].5 million. Anyway…
[B.246] Interviewee: And then we… we just keep in communication. We want to… we address local concerns. They have everyday things, like a tilt… a leaning pole, you know, unscheduled outages,
[B.247] Interviewee: You know, their meter bases on their home are all frozen over with, you know, salt and stuff.
[B.248] Interviewee: We're just always addressing local concerns like that, and then, you know, and always working on renewable energy projects, and being able to integrate those kinds of things so that we're meeting their goals.
[B.249] Interviewee: But we're also meeting AVAC goals, so just a lot of community collaboration is the bottom line, and… and that's with all three governing entities in each community, and then the, you know, the wider regional, leaderships,
[B.250] Interviewee: In the… in those particular regions.
[C.86] Interviewer: That is… that is amazing.
[C.87] Interviewer: That is, I mean, you were able to talk about so many different examples, and definitely this one about… that you most recently talked about. It's really important thinking about people's roles and, you know, their… they might not, you know, they might not know how much money this is really saving them.
[C.88] Interviewer: I mean, but they also might know, but it's just, you know, it's really important thinking about… about all of that, and thinking about those… those definite impacts, and sort of… and sort of, like, what that means, you know, like,
[C.89] Interviewer: like, like, initially, immediately, and then, like, what it means down the road, and so that is, that is really important information.
[C.90] Interviewer: So, speaking of that, what do you think the impact of COVID was? And so, as we're thinking about, like.
[C.91] Interviewer: how this global pandemic impacted so many, you know, almost everyone, you know, and… but they impacted people in different ways, and so I know that there was that,
[C.92] Interviewer: that saying or something, like, well, everybody experienced COVID, correct, everybody did experience COVID, but we experienced it differently. I remember, like, when those things happened, like, what we had to do in the classroom and all of that, but I'm sure that, like.
[C.93] Interviewer: your corporation handled this, you know, differently in thinking about all those different impacts of COVID. Like, what did that do?

Page 8

[B.251] Interviewee: Yo.
[B.252] Interviewee: Well, a lot of our community is completely locked down.
[B.253] Interviewee: There was no going in and out of them. We were… AVAC employees were considered essential employees, so we could travel.
[B.254] Interviewee: But…
[B.255] Interviewee: We had to adapt, and we had to listen individually to each community, because, you know, once… once our guys came out there with their 5, 800 pounds of gear and, you know, food and everything else that they need.
[B.256] Interviewee: They, you know, were often required to just go to the power plant and not do anything else.
[B.257] Interviewee: and then, of course,
[B.258] Interviewee: Because our… because of the fragility of… of,
[B.259] Interviewee: of just doing business in rural Location_41 and transportation specifically, transportation costs went way up during the pandemic.
[B.260] Interviewee: you know, because now everyone was home. Just like in the lower 48, you know, you read those articles about how Amazon and… and,
[B.261] Interviewee: Walmart and, you know, other online,
[B.262] Interviewee: shopping just went through the roof. Same thing happened in Location_41, but when you're sharing
[B.263] Interviewee: you know, the same single-engine or twin-engine airplane, for freight, for all of… and for passenger service, with… combined… with all of that stuff, it really made a difference in how our guys traveled to address,
[B.264] Interviewee: you know, power outages or address, routine maintenance and stuff. So we leaned heavily,
[B.265] Interviewee: On… on… on, our communities, you know,
[B.266] Interviewee: for support and to be flexible, and for safety protocols and stuff. I do want to note one thing. It was… what was really, really cool is that our regional, federally compacted health facilities got together
[B.267] Interviewee: And… and got the vaccine out regionally super quick. I was the first employee at AVAC to get the vaccine.
[B.268] Interviewee: Because it was available to Organization_15 people before it was available anywhere else.
[B.269] Interviewee: And that happened in each and every single one of our villages. It was really cool. I have to say that that was… that was probably the coolest thing out of it, but, you know, there was… we really had to adapt. Our communication had to adapt. We, you know, have a lot of…
[B.270] Interviewee: We do remote, We can remotely connect and remotely disconnect.
[B.271] Interviewee: We had to enhance that ability. We had to, you know, have safety protocols.
[B.272] Interviewee: you know, for COVID travel and those kinds of things.
[B.273] Interviewee: yeah.
[B.274] Interviewee: I mean, it increased operating costs due to travel restrictions, and so…
[B.275] Interviewee: It took a lot of effort to… to adjust to that.
[B.276] Interviewee: But AVAC did it so seamlessly, I think.
[C.94] Interviewer: That's huge, that's important.
[C.95] Interviewer: Wow. And that is… you're right, Person_2, that is really cool about, you know, that Organization_3 were the first ones to receive the vaccine, you know, that's important. That, you know, much of that should have happened, you know, in that same way, say, with, like, Organization_22.
[C.96] Interviewer: Like, it didn't happen in that same way, and trying to figure out, well.
[C.97] Interviewer: I don't know when they actually received the vaccine, but they… dealing with, like, all of the systemic issues that were happening with, like, these multi-generations being within one house, those were ongoing challenges that, like, they weren't prepared to work with.
[C.98] Interviewer: And so, we're like, well, you… we were put in these positions, and so it's just sort of like, okay, how best are we going to, like, work with this? And so…
[C.99] Interviewer: It definitely exposed a lot of things.
[B.277] Interviewee: Can I ask just a clarifying question, then? So, Does… does your tribe… Did they federally compact health?
[B.278] Interviewee: So they run the… they run the health…
[B.279] Interviewee: All your medical stuff? Or who runs your medical stuff?
[C.100] Interviewer: Sort of. Well, with… in some cases, there's… well, we… locally, we have Organization_16, which is close by, but that is a federally recognized,
[C.101] Interviewer: I think they collaborate with IHS, and IHS, that's really limited, so none of it is owned by the… well, like, I think a really small percentage is owned by the tribe. I'm not sure about the actual percentage of it.
[C.102] Interviewer: And so, that's really limited, but now it's closed, and so people need to go into, like, say if they're in Location_5.
[C.103] Interviewer: They need to travel to 45 miles or so, to go into Location_34 to get healthcare. And so, if something is serious, and if there's, like, a medical emergency, there's not, like.
[C.104] Interviewer: adequate 911 services. There are some, but there's not, like, adequate ones. So it's an ongoing challenge, you know, just trying to think about what is allowable, say, for, like, the Location_10 tribe, and then, like, what's allowable for, like, the Location_5 tribe.
[C.105] Interviewer: And, and I feel, more connected to the Location_5 tribe because I'm here, and I'm, and there's many Location_5 members that are… that are here that are close by, and, like, Location_5's close, but going over to Organization_22, it's, they have a whole set of different challenges, for sure.
[B.280] Interviewee: So, I know this isn't part of this deal, but if you… if you ever wanted a sidebar conversation about health, the way that Location_41 federally compacted our health facilities, I mean.
[B.281] Interviewee: The clinics, the sub-regional clinics, the, regional hospitals that are providing
[B.282] Interviewee: beyond primary care, they're providing secondary, tertiary, they're providing everything, and then the… when you go into Location_39, when you go to Organization_5, ANTHC, or Organization_13, Organization_9.
[B.283] Interviewee: We have the best medical and high… and the best credentialed providers in the state.
[B.284] Interviewee: Organization_4, Providence, they… they all are like this to… to… to all of our health facilities. I know that's so off-topic, but I just love learning about how Lower 48 does it. I think
[B.285] Interviewee: I mean, you guys… it…
[B.286] Interviewee: I know that we're behind in so many things, but this is one area where, like, we… I know that the health officials work with your… with all of the tribes in the lower 48. They would love to… to tell you how they did it.
[B.287] Interviewee: Because our care is insane. It is the best ever. And, you know, I saw… my dad's… my dad's in Location_13, and his… his wife is Indigenous, his wife is… Maria's, you know, they've been married for, like, 40 years or something, but
[B.288] Interviewee: She said that when they… she goes to the hospital, she goes, like.

[B.289] Interviewee: to North Dakota, I guess? I don't know, I don't remember what that hospital is, but Maria said that it… that big hospital is the size of a village clinic.
[C.106] Interviewer: Wow.
[B.290] Interviewee: I mean, yeah, it's insane. I couldn't… yeah, anyway… I really hope that
[B.291] Interviewee: Yeah, I know it's so off-topic, but that's one of the things that we, all of us Indigenous people, need.
[C.107] Interviewer: Absolutely, it's so true. And it's really not that off-topic. I think it's… I mean, it's definitely relevant to, like, the role of the organizations, and then the roles that the people play in thinking about what they're going to do, and then how they're doing it, and who the services are for.
[C.108] Interviewer: So that's definitely important information. There's so much that, like, we could learn from
[C.109] Interviewer: From the way that, you know, things are being done there, for sure.
[C.110] Interviewer: It's exciting
[C.111] Interviewer: And it's just, you know, thinking about all of these things, thinking about, you know, the roles that, like, these organizations… well, your organization plays, and then…
[C.112] Interviewer: It's not, you know, places, you know, isn't an adequate word, because
[C.113] Interviewer: you know, they have a significant role in the community. Like, your work is important. I mean, as people look to you, they're looking to you as a community and tribal leader as well, and thinking about, like, what they can do next, you know, what they need to do.
[C.114] Interviewer: And it's really exciting thinking about, where things are going. So how do you envision
[C.115] Interviewer: you know, you're… you're cooperative for the future. Like, how do you think…
[C.116] Interviewer: things are going to, like… should they stay the same? Should they… are they going to grow in different ways that you can anticipate? What do you think about… for the future?
[B.292] Interviewee: Yeah, I mean, I think we… I talked a little bit about this earlier, but it, you know, things are changing, and we're all going to have to adapt.
[B.293] Interviewee: AVAC, but each and every one of our members, member owners in each and every one of our villages.
[B.294] Interviewee: The funding decline is a real thing, and it's a critical, critical threat.
[B.295] Interviewee: to how we do business for everything from delivering electricity to delivering, you know,
Person_2, groceries, everything is changing.
[B.296] Interviewee: And, and, you know, the, the federal subsidies to get, bypass mail.
[B.297] Interviewee: which includes, you know, groceries, and, you know, it can often include, like, every single piece of 2x4, or nail, or everything that gets into a community. All of that funding
[B.298] Interviewee: is in jeopardy. It's being talked about now. What… and then, combined with, everything melting.
[B.299] Interviewee: what is that going to look like for our communities? What… what is that going to look like for AVAC? There are a handfuls of communities that have been trying to… to move.
[B.300] Interviewee: And they've been doing that. NewTalk is one. It… they… they're sinking.
[B.301] Interviewee: So they… they have moved to Michtowvak, which means fresh water, but I call it newer talk, because I just like to be funny. It's not one of our communities, but there's example after example of that, where new school had to be constructed, a new power plant, all the homes had to be, constructed and moved. And those… that is
[B.302] Interviewee: hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars worth of infrastructure. Location_22, Shishmarath, Shakhtulik, Nunapichak. I mean, there's example after example after example of communities that,
[B.303] Interviewee: you know, their, their, shorelines are eroding, their, the land that they're sitting on is no longer there. And, you know, like, Location_22 is a good example.
[B.304] Interviewee: They're right on the Bering Sea, and… and… no.
[B.305] Interviewee: Location_22 is not on the Bering Sea. Let me make sure that I have this right. Location_22 is…
[B.306] Interviewee: Bering… it's not on the Bering Sea.
[B.307] Interviewee: Chuck Cheese C. I wanted to make sure that I had that right.
[B.308] Interviewee: But it's located on a barrier reef, like several of those communities are, and so there's a lagoon side, and then the Chukchi Sea side, and you have the storms that I was talking about for Location_1, Location_22, and those communities.
[B.309] Interviewee: Where they had to evacuate, and the runways are underwater, homes are underwater.
[B.310] Interviewee: the whole community is underwater. Those, I mean.
[B.311] Interviewee: those are real things that are happening, and Location_22, they built a…
[B.312] Interviewee: I think it's an 8-mile evacuation road, and the new school is out there. That… that was hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars to do. We built an inner tie out there, we got funding to build an inner tie out there.
[B.313] Interviewee: But…
[B.314] Interviewee: that's gonna… we're going… as a state, and as rural Alaskans, we're really gonna have to look at how we do business like that in the future, because there's not hundreds of million dollars to move, a couple of hundred people, you know.
[B.315] Interviewee: to a different… to a different site.
[B.316] Interviewee: there's operational impacts at AVAC that, you know, for logistics, that can… will continue to… to happen if…
[B.317] Interviewee: Especially if the… the subsidy, you know, subsidies were to go away for… for delivering, you know, passengers and materials. That's… I keep getting interrupted. I should have muted everything, sorry.
[B.318] Interviewee: So, and then, you know, that… that will impact how we do business, because everything, like, poles, you have to, you know, power poles, you have to put them in the ground, and if the… if it… and the existing ones that are all leaning… I just got a video the other day of… of some leaning poles, sort of leaning from
[B.319] Interviewee: Like, the 10 o'clock position to the 2 o'clock position.
[B.320] Interviewee: That's it, right? That's… that's how critical It's…
[B.321] Interviewee: the permafrost is… and the… and the weather is changing. We have to… and that's not just an AVAC problem, that… that's a problem for everything that's in the community.
[B.322] Interviewee: So, you know, resili… we need to focus on… on planning,
[B.323] Interviewee: For resiliency, and for… and find different, you know, innovative ways to find funding, and all of that
[B.324] Interviewee: Can't be done without
[B.325] Interviewee: the community and AVAC and all of the other entities just working so tightly together to… to make sure that we're citing energy projects in the right places, so that we're looking out, you know, in the future.
[B.326] Interviewee: 50 years, 100 years, to make sure that, you know, that… that we're citing things in a way that make the most sense and are the safest for the communities.

Page 10

[B.327] Interviewee: But it's, you know, it's something that Location_41 Who is not used to
[B.328] Interviewee: and Alaskans aren't used to, but it's something that we're all gonna have to start looking at, because
[B.329] Interviewee: The combination of funding declines and climate threats, is, is, you know, forcing us to do business in different ways.
[B.330] Interviewee: And, you know, maybe instead of moving a community, communities are going to have to merge with others, like we, you know, have done for
[B.331] Interviewee: for millennia,
[B.332] Interviewee: And, you know, I talk about that. I get pretty sensitive and very protective of our communities. The reason why we have these communities is because we were forced to go to school, you know, and forced to do those kinds of things.
[B.333] Interviewee: So, I understand nobody wants to move, and it's real easy to, you know, to talk about.
[C.117] Interviewer: you know.
[B.334] Interviewee: you know, suggesting that to other people, but if you're the person that people are suggesting that to, you'd be pretty offended. But…
[B.335] Interviewee: we have to come up with different solutions on how we're going to do things. If your community is not going to be there.
[C.118] Interviewer: In 10 years.
[B.336] Interviewee: What are we gonna do? What does that mean for all of the infrastructure there? The existing infrastructure?
[C.119] Interviewer: Right.
[C.120] Interviewer: Absolutely, that is important.
[C.121] Interviewer: people… everyone needs to be thinking about that. You know, when you're talking about that, it reminds me of, like, the force removal that people had, you know, like, in places like Location_35.
[C.122] Interviewer: And then how people were working with the forced genocide during, like, Organization_12, like, the whole reason for Organization_12. And it's just amazing, you know, to think about, like, well.
[C.123] Interviewer: People were forced to do these different things, and this is where we are now.
[C.124] Interviewer: This is the situation that everybody needs to be aware of, you know.
[C.125] Interviewer: these changes, like you're mentioning, with, like, the poll going from, like, being at 10 o'clock going to 2 o'clock, and, like, that's a significant change that…
[C.126] Interviewer: People are not, you know, if they might see, like, Tundra, but they don't know how to, like, work with it, they don't know, like, they don't have the knowledge, the background knowledge to be able to, like, work with that the best way possible.
[C.127] Interviewer: That is some definite knowledge that you're sharing with us. And I really want to say thank you for taking the time.
[C.128] Interviewer: to… to meet with us, to impart so much knowledge and information. I'm…
[C.129] Interviewer: I've learned so much today, and I'm looking forward to, like, our group learning more, you know, about everything that you're sharing. Learning from your conversation and the things that you shared today, that's really beneficial. Were there things that we didn't talk about? Because I know that you mentioned that you have bullet points.
[C.130] Interviewer: Did we talk about the things she wanted to discuss?
[B.337] Interviewee: Oh, just, let me look.
[B.338] Interviewee: I don't… I don't think so. I think I've covered… I think we've covered sort of everything,
[B.339] Interviewee: I'm really hoping that… I don't… are you gonna publish this somewhere?
[C.131] Interviewer: that's the hope, that the students will help, they will, you know, look at these different types of information, look at the different themes, you know, like, I'm gonna help them go through coding, and then,
[C.132] Interviewer: Looking at cleaning up the transcripts, cleaning up, you know, like, because
[C.133] Interviewer: I, you know, like, I stumbled across, like, some different words, and so they're gonna clean those things up, and then, they're gonna help with, like, the different things that… that need to be cleaned up. And then, yes, we will eventually publish.
[C.134] Interviewer: But we'll definitely keep you in, you know, in step in all the different ways, all the different times, you know, that we're going to, like, be looking at these things and all of that.
[C.135] Interviewer: And as part of that, if you're able to send me your address for a thank you gift, we certainly appreciate the time that you've taken, you know, to meet and to talk about these things, and…
[C.136] Interviewer: we… this is… this is huge, this is important information, and I'm… I'm so thankful.
[B.340] Interviewee: Thank you! Yeah, I just wanted… I just…
[B.341] Interviewee: I hope that if, before you publish, like, you, I can be included in the draft, just in case I, you know.
[B.342] Interviewee: Just… just to clarify anything, or make sure that there's no wrong information.
[C.137] Interviewer: Oh, most definitely, and we'll send something back to you and say, is this what you wanted to say, and all of this.
[C.138] Interviewer: I'll make sure that I have that.
[B.343] Interviewee: like, I'm sure that, you know, AVAC employees wouldn't be happy with, you know, me sharing our business about the, you know, leaning poles, but, you know, as a… as a…
[B.344] Interviewee: As a villager and as a AVAC member, those are things that we really… that are real, everyday life, and we… and we do need to talk about them, because they are different.
[B.345] Interviewee: It's different… we deal with really weird, different things.
[C.139] Interviewer: Exactly.
Person_2, thank you so much!
[C.140] Interviewer: Absolutely, and thank you, Dawaii, for taking the time. Appreciate it.
[C.141] Interviewer: And I will send this to you, and then if you can send me your mailing address, that'd be great. Even via email is perfect, and so…
[B.346] Interviewee: Okay.
[C.142] Interviewer: That'd be wonderful.
[B.347] Interviewee: Thank you. Bye, Pam. Pamela.
[A.3] Interviewer: Sorry, I was on mute. Oh my gosh!
[A.4] Interviewer: I'm… just really appreciate your time. And I'm going to be sending you a list of all of the U.S. Native-led Organization_17 here, so that you can see where they're at. Even… there's even some more up in Location_41, you probably know about them.

Page 11

[A.5] Interviewer: But, I will send you that list. I'm also gonna send you some resources, of places for,
[A.6] Interviewer: you know, to get help for other… for other types of funding in the lower 48. I don't know how much it'll help you up in Location_14. I mean, up in Location_41, I'm sorry. And, but I… I'll get that information to you.
[A.7] Interviewer: So, I'll… I'm working on the list to update it.
[A.8] Interviewer: And, that way I'll have some contact information, website information, and then you can talk to these people, because you're not alone with what you're dealing with, with climate change. There's a group of women on Organization_19. They have to grow the corn differently, their white corn.
[A.9] Interviewer: Because they're getting flooded every year now, and their corn was just dying in the field because it was underwater. So now they're growing their corn up on mounds.
[A.10] Interviewer: And, so that it's… the roots are protected from rotting in the wet soil. And so, there's just things happening. We're going to be interviewing an agricultural, group in Tohona Odom.
[A.11] Interviewer: And they've been dealing with some things that they fought for water rights. And because of their co-op, they were able to protect their aquifer underneath their tribal lands, under their traditional territory.
[A.12] Interviewer: And, they couldn't have done that without the government and the members working together. They unified their voices, and they… they… they won and beat Location_38, Location_8.
[A.13] Interviewer: You know, so… and those are things we don't hear about enough in our communities, where, you know, we're always fighting Goliath. There's a group up in,
Person_1 that is still trying to get
[A.14] Interviewer: The oil pipelines removed from their land.
[A.15] Interviewer: that they had told the pipeline people that they did not approve it, they wanted it gone. They've been fighting in court for 10 years.
[A.16] Interviewer: And those pipelines are still there, and they haven't been maintained.
[A.17] Interviewer: And so… and they're a huge waterway, you know, water on their land, you know, on their traditional territories, so there's just a lot of things going on, and…
[A.18] Interviewer: I'm just… I'm so excited to hear the things that you're doing in your community, and, you know, maybe just somebody like us from down south, we, you know, our utilities here in Location_31, they run 13 cents to 15 cents a kilowatt hour.
[A.19] Interviewer: Yeah.
[A.20] Interviewer: And so, you know, you hear about something like what up there, what you're paying for, you know, your cost of living, it's so different, but just because of the remoteness. But just… you just… I can just see, I can feel your beautiful spirit, and how much you love your community, and I'm glad they have somebody like you.
[A.21] Interviewer: That's there, and that understands the ins and outs of working with, like, your village leadership and… and the community. So, Person_2, it's been a pleasure meeting you.
[B.348] Interviewee: It's a pleasure meeting you both, too. I want to… I have a little brag. My little sister was the first Location_24
[B.349] Interviewee: and Indigenous person to get elected to Location_41's
[B.350] Interviewee: congressional… U.S. congressional seat, Person_8.
[A.22] Interviewer: Oh…
[B.351] Interviewee: And I just… I just have to brag, because I thought you guys might know who she was, or is. She lost… she lost this… this time, but who knows, she might… she'll probably run for something else. She's always been pretty political. Do you guys know who she is?
[A.23] Interviewer: No!
[C.143] Interviewer: I've heard her name, but I don't know who her… I don't know her… who she is.
[A.24] Interviewer: Yeah, I've.
[B.352] Interviewee: No problem.
[A.25] Interviewer: Brendawn, she's on the Location_25 Reservation, she's 74. She's running for, the Senate seat in Location_8.
[A.26] Interviewer: I know! And I just… I look at her, and she's, like, 4'8", you know, this little tiny Dine woman, you know, and she raises all of her sheep, and she's just fierce. And her daughter is running again as a U.S. representative, in Location_8, so…
[A.27] Interviewer: It's… we need that representation, and we're so far behind.
[A.28] Interviewer: So, that's exciting!
[B.353] Interviewee: Isn't Person_9 from Location_8, or no?
[C.144] Interviewer: She's from the Organization_18, actually. And so we just… I just got a chance to see her last Monday, back during our feed day, so it was just great, because we were taking some photos, and if you want, I can send those to you as well. And so, it's just exciting. Yes, we need that representation for sure.
[B.354] Interviewee: We love Person_9 in Location_41.
[A.29] Interviewer: She was great in Organization_14, oh my gosh. It's finally… we had somebody that understood what they were doing.
[C.145] Interviewer: Right. Jeez.
[A.30] Interviewer: just crazy.
[A.31] Interviewer: Well, thank you again.
[B.355] Interviewee: Okay.
[A.32] Interviewer: Alright, you have a beautiful weekend!
[B.356] Interviewee: Okay, you guys too.
[A.33] Interviewer: Okay, talk with you. I'll be sending you an email real soon, and then I have a gift that I've made, and we'll… and Person_3 has some things, and we'll send it up as a thank you to your, you know, to your organization and to you for your time.
[B.357] Interviewee: Thank you, thank you!
[A.34] Interviewer: Take care.
[C.146] Interviewer: Thank you.
[B.358] Interviewee: Okay, bye.
[A.35] Interviewer: Alright, bye-bye.
[A.36] Interviewer: Did you want to talk to me, or are you feeling okay?
[C.147] Interviewer: I'm feeling good, let me, press the…
