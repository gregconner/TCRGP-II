Organization_5 – Person_2
[A.1] Interviewer: Wonderful, good morning. So, my name is, Person_1, and, I'm from the Organization_21. I'm also Danae, on myâ€¦ on my mom's side, and then I'm a Ciniboine and Sioux on my dad's side. And, Person_10
[A.2] Interviewer: So we wereâ€¦
[A.3] Interviewer: I get a chance to talk with, with you today, Person_2, about some of these amazing things that you're doing with the Organization_4
Person_1. And you can, hopefully tell us more about, like, the actual name thatâ€¦ that I might have butchered just now, and, we can go from there.
[B.1] Interviewee: Okay, so thank you for, allowing me to speak with you today. I'm Person_2, I'm the Organization_10.
[B.2] Interviewee: We started TIWA back in, [Year]. Organization_6, and I was managing their, Person_10 they had 117 units, and then we wereâ€¦ I was re-implementing them, helping them re-implement their home loan program.
[B.3] Interviewee: The home loan program was to help middle to high-income borrowers, because the housing authority, you know, serviced the low-income borrowers. But even though we don't really look at it.
[B.4] Interviewee: I mean, in our line of business, we don't really look at your low income. We treat everybody pretty much the same, and you qualify based on your income and credit.
[B.5] Interviewee: And so the program that we designed is we wanted to be thisâ€¦
[B.6] Interviewee: this mortgage company that was going to be helping, the Location_7 tribal members.
[B.7] Interviewee: For home, you know, home ownership, and then plus any development services that would come along with that. And then we were originally gonnaâ€¦ I started off, we were gonna do small micro-business loans.
[B.8] Interviewee: So I got the program up and running in [Year], and we started off, with, I think, a million and a half, and now our loan portfolio has grown to almost [Financial_Amount]. Actually, real close to a little in between.
[B.9] Interviewee: up to [Financial_Amount], so it's grown. We have almost a zero to, zero default on our mortgages.
[B.10] Interviewee: And I think why that has been so successful is because we've really focused on financial empowerment, Organization_14.
[B.11] Interviewee: financial literacy, spending a lot of time with the youth, because that's where it starts. And so, throughout the years, we justâ€¦ there was a lot of, Person_10 home ownership was hard. Obtaining home ownership on this letter reservation was very hard, and very time-consuming.
[B.12] Interviewee: It was taking us about maybe a year and a half to get our tribal members into a home, as opposed to off the reservation. You could close on a loan in 30 days.
[B.13] Interviewee: And, Person_10
[B.14] Interviewee: And boom, that was it. And, you know, we'd order the appraisals so that theâ€¦ all those, Person_10
[B.15] Interviewee: all the technologyâ€¦ everything that we needed to do off the reservationâ€¦ I mean, off the reservation was easier, but the compliance, it was a lot harder to find, like, contractors to build homes. Theyâ€¦ making sure that they weren't taking advantage of the tribal members.
[B.16] Interviewee: I mean, so there was just a lot ofâ€¦ there was a lot of components that were holding Organization_14 as the tribal members, back.
[B.17] Interviewee: from obtaining a home on the reservation. So we had to do, like, a lot of meetings with Organization_15. We had, not only that, but it was, like, the processâ€¦
[B.18] Interviewee: To start off, was we had to develop a site process application.
[B.19] Interviewee: And with this side process application, we created it to help guide the tribal members, like, in the different steps. And so there was, like, 7 different departments that they needed to go through. Once we established
[B.20] Interviewee: The whole idea was to makeâ€¦ streamline it, and make it easier for them to obtain all, because the process was so hideous, it was just, like, it took forever.
[B.21] Interviewee: tribal members were getting frustrated, andâ€¦ you know, and so a lot of the 184 lenders off the reservation were having a hard time lending money toâ€¦ on the reservation because of all the hiccups that we had.
[B.22] Interviewee: So we try to streamline everything. So through that, we realized how important financial literacy was. So they kind of go hand in hand. So while we were working on streamlining
[B.23] Interviewee: home ownership on the reservation, we also realized that in order for our tribal members to be successful, we needed to start off with financial literacy.
[B.24] Interviewee: So weâ€¦ back in [Year],
[B.25] Interviewee: that's when I started seeing a need for the financial literacy, and then I branchedâ€¦ I collaborated with Habitat for Humanity.
[B.26] Interviewee: And they came in, and they did an 11-week financial literacy course. And from there, itâ€¦ we spent, like, 4 weeks on budgeting and savings.
[B.27] Interviewee: Going over credit reports.
[B.28] Interviewee: What else? We did credit reports, like, talking about foreclosure, what a FICO score was, how to look at your credit, your needs, buying, you know, buying, is it a need or is it a want? And so we spent, like, 90 days
[B.29] Interviewee: Toâ€¦ to change everybody's life, to help change those habits.
[B.30] Interviewee: And it started with the financial literacy. So we created this program. So after we completed the Habitat for Humanity.
[B.31] Interviewee: then I said, okay, well, I think I could do this. So we started off with Person_3, andâ€¦ but then I realizedâ€¦ so insteadâ€¦ so we were beingâ€¦ we were, like, the facilitators, but at the same time, he would come up and he would speak, so he engaged the audience, they feltâ€¦
[B.32] Interviewee: It was justâ€¦ it was nice, because they learned a lot, and so it made it easier for them to take time
[B.33] Interviewee: an hour and a half out of their schedule to come in and get this financial literacy. And then they graduated, they went through the full 11 weeks. Then from there, it was so successful, we opened it up to the whole tribe.
[A.4] Interviewer: Then from there, we kind of created our own.
[B.34] Interviewee: Weâ€¦ we started, doing it, like, once a year.
[B.35] Interviewee: And it becameâ€¦ that program became very successful. So we started collaborating withâ€¦ with Organization_3. We opened it up to the community, and then our goal, our mission, was always
[B.36] Interviewee: To, you know, provide Organization_14, opportunities, micro-business loans.
[B.37] Interviewee: But then we kind of felt like there wasn't really a need for, like, the micro-business loans, so we went to consumer loans. So we said, let's go ahead and introduceâ€¦ soâ€¦ so I guess backing up, our development services took off and became very successful.
[B.38] Interviewee: And we had at least, I would say, on an average, at the time that when we started, about 32 students, participants, that went through the whole 90-day challenge of financial literacy. And they learned a lot, and then from there, it helped us
[B.39] Interviewee: So when they did borrow money toâ€¦ for a home, then they realized the importance of home ownership, making your payments when they were due in a timely manner, learning about their credit. So that kind of startedâ€¦ that went hand in hand. And because of that program being so successful.
[B.40] Interviewee: with our loan portfolio being up to close, maybe, [Financial_Amount], we have only had maybe one default, and that's just happening right now. But that's okay, because we still work with them. We don't just say, okay, you're not making your payments, we're going to foreclose on you. We're going to work with you, we're going to help you.
[B.41] Interviewee: Andâ€¦ but it's also up to yourâ€¦ it's also up to you to help yourself, too. And soâ€¦ but I think that'sâ€¦ Iâ€¦ I feel very confident in saying that that's due to the success of the financial literacy program, then that's why our home buyers are so successful.
[B.42] Interviewee: then we were like, well, the micro-business loans, let's see what we can do with the micro business loans. Well, it's a little bit harder, because you can't just lendâ€¦ you can't go to a normal bank
[B.43] Interviewee: andâ€¦ and borrow money to start up your business. And so we said, let's help these borrowers, and kind of, like, createâ€¦ let's be creative, think out of the box, and let's look intoâ€¦
[B.44] Interviewee: You know, a lot of our tribal members don't do any business tax returns.

Page 2

[B.45] Interviewee: They don't know anything about, like, the profit and loss and everything that you have to go through to start a business, right? So, is there a need? There really wasn't a need.
[B.46] Interviewee: For it at that time, and we really didn't have that experience inâ€¦ in underwriting.
[B.47] Interviewee: the micro-small business loans. So we started partnering up with, like, the loan fund, and let them underwrite the loans.
[B.48] Interviewee: And then we would service them, and we would still figure out a way to try to help.
[B.49] Interviewee: A tribal member start their, their business.
[B.50] Interviewee: Well, with that, we ended up
[B.51] Interviewee: saying, let's do consumer loans. So under this umbrella, we have down payment assistance, we have debt consolidation, we have, credit management, helping them to review their credit.
[B.52] Interviewee: personal loans, and we'll sort them off like that. And then, if they wanted to maybe buy a car loan, we kind of put all those little products under the consumer loans.
[B.53] Interviewee: So, then the next goal was, let's go ahead and the consumer loans took off. So we didâ€¦ and I think that's when I hired Miranda. She started with us in,
[B.54] Interviewee: I think [Year]. She's been with us 10 years, and I said, okay, you're gonnaâ€¦ you're gonna take over the consumer loan program, and then we're gonnaâ€¦ you're gonna take over the financial literacy.
[B.55] Interviewee: So she's done an outstanding job, and she's made this program so successful.
[B.56] Interviewee: So, so with her growth in learning, she started off with no office experience.
[B.57] Interviewee: And she was an intern from Isletta. And from there, she came in as an intern, and she's never left.
[B.58] Interviewee: So she's been a tremendous asset to Organization_5, and hopefully one day the goal is to have her take over. And so with that, so we're like, okay, we're gettingâ€¦ the next step is, let's lend off the reservation.
[B.59] Interviewee: So then we were likeâ€¦ so we decided to lend off the reservation.
[B.60] Interviewee: And then from there, we were like, oh no.
[B.61] Interviewee: The minute we left the reservation, we lost our sovereignty.
[B.62] Interviewee: So we became subject to the Location_5 state laws, so we had to get licensed to become a loan officer. But nobody in the honest letter really knew anything about mortgages.
[B.63] Interviewee: and consumer loans, because our whole goal, and I hope I'm not backtracking, but our whole goal was to stay away from payday lenders.
[B.64] Interviewee: And, you know, to help our tribal members stay away from payday lenders. And from there.
[B.65] Interviewee: it justâ€¦ the program grew. Like I said, we went from 1.5 million to almost close to [Financial_Amount].5 million now, with a 0%
[B.66] Interviewee: delinquency. We know we have borrowers that are late. Of course, our consumer loans are a little bit different, because they're a little bit more riskier, and they have a little bit of higher interest rates, but they're short-term loans. And that was another way of us generating additional income.
[B.67] Interviewee: You know, to help make our organization profitable. So withâ€¦
[B.68] Interviewee: With us helping the community in home ownership and with consumer loans, you have to think of the
[B.69] Interviewee: The aspect of it on the business side.
[B.70] Interviewee: So you have to continue to keep your organization growing, and how are you going to do that? So, with the short staff that we had, Miranda and I were handling both. We were wearingâ€¦
[B.71] Interviewee: So, out of a lot of native city advice, they have, like, maybe 7 different workers, doing different things. Well, Miranda and I took off, and we were doing both of that.
[B.72] Interviewee: And then we started havingâ€¦ then we collaborated with Organization_2 to service our loans. So we became strong in that product because they were in compliance with the collections, they helped us more with the collections and the servicing of the loan. So I think that was one smart move that we did.
[B.73] Interviewee: And then you have the accounting aspect. So in your organization, you have this organizational chart. You know, so you have to create a board, and then the board
[B.74] Interviewee: Then you have, like, the ED, and then you have, like.
[B.75] Interviewee: Accounting, and then you have the staff, and then in thoseâ€¦ and part of the staff is
[B.76] Interviewee: different roles.
[B.77] Interviewee: And how are you going to continue toâ€¦ and I think that's why it's so important
[B.78] Interviewee: Starting a nonprofit or getting into businesses is letting the youth know
[B.79] Interviewee: Or the any adults, is that, how are you going to maintain your business and keep it successfully running?
[B.80] Interviewee: You know, so I thinkâ€¦ so then with that, in that aspect, on the organizational part, we'reâ€¦ we were like, okay, you know what? We're 16 years in existence, now what's the next step for growth? So I think we're ready to hire somebody else. So we gave anotherâ€¦
[B.81] Interviewee: job opportunity to Gabriel. Gabriel started working with us, never been in the business, and neither has Miranda. So I've been in the business, like, overâ€¦ I've been doing this sinceâ€¦
[B.82] Interviewee: I don't know, beforeâ€¦ because I originally started off working in the bank.
[B.83] Interviewee: And then I went to the title company, and then I opened up my own mortgage company, and then I started working here, so I've been 16 years here.
[B.84] Interviewee: So it's taken me probablyâ€¦ I have, like, I don't know, over maybe 35 years of experience. So bringing Miranda in and Gabriel with no experience is to see how much they're blossoming now to be wonderful leaders is a great example for our youth.
[B.85] Interviewee: And it introduces a new line of work and job creativity.
[B.86] Interviewee: You know, on this letter.
[B.87] Interviewee: So, I guess taking that a step further, so we've grown, so it's taken us 16 years, and we're like, okay, we're here, what are we gonna do now?
[B.88] Interviewee: Andâ€¦ Hold on, what?
[B.89] Interviewee: Person_11 but, Person_10
[B.90] Interviewee: So sorry about that. But, so then from there, we're like, we're ready to do that next step of growth, what are we gonna do? So we left the reservation.
[B.91] Interviewee: Andâ€¦ weâ€¦
[B.92] Interviewee: And that was probably one of our challenges. We've had a lot of barriers that we overcame, and we overcame those barriers, and then now.
[B.93] Interviewee: going off the reservation, it opened up a whole, like, the insurances. So you have to have insurances to run your organization. So now, with the type of mortgage company that we are, CDFI,
[B.94] Interviewee: We have directors' and officers' insurance, we have errors and omissions, workers' liability, workers' compensation, Person_10

Page 3

[B.95] Interviewee: a general, you know, it justâ€¦ it goes on. And that was costing us, like, [Financial_Amount] a year to run this business. And then the rent. Organization_19.
[B.96] Interviewee: And we just moved here back this week, and it's saving us [Financial_Amount].
[B.97] Interviewee: And, you know, in income. So now we're able to spread that and put it back in the community. Now our goal is to become that premier mortgage company for the other pueblos.
[B.98] Interviewee: And we'reâ€¦ we've extended our products toâ€¦
[B.99] Interviewee: Location_7, I mean, to Location_8, Location_1, and Valencia County. And then other counties, like Case by Case. But with that comes always having to raise money
[B.100] Interviewee: for loans, so we need capital to continue to re-lend out. And so that's been, you know, that's tough. And with everything going on with the government today, with administration, and a lot of the programs that are freezing, and the funding, we have to still be careful, because we still want to be able to be
[B.101] Interviewee: successful, and not shut down. You know, so we're operating still with 3 people, and we're still making it work. Now we'reâ€¦ we're really excited, because we're going to a step further, and we're going to start learning on how to maybe sell our loans.
[B.102] Interviewee: To the secondary market. And then from us selling our loans, then we'll be able to get new capital to re-lend out.
[B.103] Interviewee: And then, that's new for us. And then we're also going to collaborate with, the CDFI Clearinghouse.
[B.104] Interviewee: And we're going to be able to see if we can go to different pueblos and haveâ€¦ maybe help them with community projects.
[B.105] Interviewee: Andâ€¦ and see what their need is, and then we can provide the capital with them, and we're going to be that middleman.
[B.106] Interviewee: And then, so that's another growth thing. And then the next thing is we're partneringâ€¦ we're like, okay, let's take on the micro small business loans, like commercial lending. So now we'reâ€¦ now we're tapping our toes, dipping our toes into commercial lending.
[B.107] Interviewee: Andâ€¦
[B.108] Interviewee: small micro-business loans. So we have another partner with Organization_17 that we're going to be working with, and they have the capital, but now we're going that step further. How do youâ€¦
[B.109] Interviewee: let's educate the community and anybody else that wants to hire, that wants to start a nonprofit. What do you need to do to start a nonprofit? What are the steps? How are you going to maybe teach them about theirâ€¦ theirâ€¦ how to file your taxes, the articles of a corporation? You know, you gotta create bylaws, you gotta have a board.
[B.110] Interviewee: all that fun stuff, and you gotta apply with the EIN, with the treasure, with theâ€¦
[B.111] Interviewee: state IRS, and it just goes on, but you would never have known. See, I come from working from the profit toâ€¦ and then all of a sudden, a nonprofit. That was a big experience. That was a big change for me, because I never knew anything about resolutions and bylaws andâ€¦
[B.112] Interviewee: and articles, and minutes. I never knew anything about that. Although, it was all corporation stuff.
[B.113] Interviewee: And then, so now that we got that kind of, you know, so being in compliance, watching our funding, and then also collaborating with Organization_12, maybe, Organization_13, Organization_20, all those other lenders off the reservation. So right now, it's still very difficult
[B.114] Interviewee: It's still very difficult toâ€¦
[B.115] Interviewee: It's still closed alone on the reservations.
[B.116] Interviewee: Because you only have a 184 lender that will hold those loans.
[B.117] Interviewee: And if they're having a hard time closing loans on the reservation.
[B.118] Interviewee: then that's where we come in as that premier mortgage company, because we kind of know what we'reâ€¦ we're tailoring all our needs and everything to the community, and we understand what they have to go through. So I think with all that experience, our goal is to be that premier mortgage company, or CDFI, forâ€¦
[B.119] Interviewee: For those tribal members.
[B.120] Interviewee: Did I tell you too much? No.
[A.5] Interviewer: No, that's perfect! I mean, that's justâ€¦ it's, you know, you're really, like, creating this wonderful bridge between, like, what people need to know and what they don't know.
[A.6] Interviewer: You know, have grown up, you know, just doing a variety of different things, and they haveâ€¦
[A.7] Interviewer: knowledge in these other areas, but they don't know, like, so many other things that they're getting themselves into. Especially as you're talking about, like, home ownership and, like.
[A.8] Interviewer: owning a business and all of that. I mean, like, when I was first buying a home, like, I did not know any of that stuff. And so, it's not stuff, but any of that information, and I just didn't know, like, what to do next.
[B.121] Interviewee: Yeah, and it's intimidating. And soâ€¦ so based on that, now that you're askedâ€¦ that we just said that, then we said, okay, where does it start with? It starts with the youth. So weâ€¦ if we start educating the youth now.
[B.122] Interviewee: can youâ€¦ can you imagine what kind of leadershipâ€¦ leaders they're going to be moving forward? So then, we partnered up, when we were here at Asleta, when we first started, we came in and we partnered up with,
[B.123] Interviewee: gosh, Person_5, and he was on a biggerâ€¦ pardon, my mind just went blank, but theyâ€¦
[B.124] Interviewee: wereâ€¦ they wanted to get together with us, and we did this big Organization_9.
[B.125] Interviewee: And weâ€¦ we reached out to all the schools in the state of Location_5 for Native Americans, and then we said, we're going to put this one-day event on, and we're going to have different types ofâ€¦
[B.126] Interviewee: sessions for them to educate them, and we're going to provide a nice sit-down lunch for them, so they can come in, maybe get dressed up, kind of get them in that networking environment, and teach them about the importance of credit. So we had special speakers coming in throughout the years.
[B.127] Interviewee: That's been really successful. They, Person_10
[B.128] Interviewee: We've beenâ€¦ this is our sixth one. We'veâ€¦ we're having another one now in March.
[B.129] Interviewee: Andâ€¦ and we'll, you know, invite you guys if you haveâ€¦ and it goes all the way from, like, weâ€¦ you know, well, we really focus maybe more, like, on 7th grade on up to college, but even teaching my grandkids now, like, counting money and talking to them about credit, that's where it'sâ€¦
[B.130] Interviewee: That's where it starts.
[B.131] Interviewee: So, we'll put onâ€¦ weâ€¦ in these sessions, we did, we partnered up with Organization_23, and then, we have, like, all the schools come in, and we'll do a session on what is credit.
[B.132] Interviewee: And then we just did another session, Leaving the Nest.
[B.133] Interviewee: And that's to let you know what is the difference between when you graduate as a senior and yourâ€¦ the 3 years from a senior to, 21.
[B.134] Interviewee: then you could still obtain a home, and this is what you can start getting. So weâ€¦ we kind of talked to him about, renting versus buying, new construction asâ€¦ as opposed to purchasing. Then we started teaching them about allâ€¦ we did a scan, and like, this is what the lingo of a realtor, a mortgage.
[B.135] Interviewee: a CDFI, this is an appraiser, a broker, and just kind of likeâ€¦ because it's intimidating.
[B.136] Interviewee: And so theyâ€¦ they should be able to walk away saying, oh, I've heard about what a realtor does. And it opens the doors to ifâ€¦
[B.137] Interviewee: on a professional level, do they want to become a realtor? Do they want to be a financial education coach? Do they want to go into banking? That, like, there's aâ€¦ there's this whole other business growth opportunities for them. It's, you know, to let them know that this
[B.138] Interviewee: Because really, nobody knows about how to go become a loan officer.
[B.139] Interviewee: Or what you need to do, or how do you become a realtor, or what does an appraiser do? And that opens the doors for them also.
[B.140] Interviewee: And so then from there, we'll doâ€¦ then we have a spending frenzy where they count money.

Page 4

[B.141] Interviewee: So, we'll give themâ€¦ we have different volunteers that come in, and they'll give them maybe [Financial_Amount] and they'll say, well, how much can you spend with this [Financial_Amount]? Then they have different groups sitting down, and it's like, oh, do we want to buyâ€¦ do we want to get a meal package?
[B.142] Interviewee: And, you know, how much money do we want to spend on meals for the year? Oh, we want to buy a car. Do we want to buy a home? Do we want to rent? Then they have to go to the table and pay for everything that they want. And it just shows you how to budget.
[B.143] Interviewee: that [Financial_Amount] and how fast that 30,000â€¦ we were doing 50,000, but nowadays we thought, well, we better lower it to maybe 30. That's been reallyâ€¦ and the kids love it. So thatâ€¦ we have that, and then we'll have another one on, just different things, I mean, like banking, maybe how to
[B.144] Interviewee: Purchase an auto loan.
[B.145] Interviewee: mental health with money, because mental health, you know, comes in, and if there's problems at home, and if they see that financially, it affects you mentally in any household, you know, just budgeting. So I think we really focus on all those, so that's where that program's been very successful.
[B.146] Interviewee: And we did get some money from Person_6, our financialâ€¦ and I don't know if you've heard of Person_6. She donated a million dollars to us. We never even heard of her, but I think just because she heard what we were doing.
[B.147] Interviewee: And so she donated us, donated that money. And thenâ€¦ so thenâ€¦ oh, then we alsoâ€¦ the new one that we did is how to start a small business.
[B.148] Interviewee: So we offered that session. So they walked in, and they were likeâ€¦ and it was really interesting to see the students, how they wanted to start off in movie theater, and how they wanted to come and open up a movie, a theater.
[B.149] Interviewee: For drama, and just maybe a food truck.
[B.150] Interviewee: So it was kind of nice to hear that they'reâ€¦ they're very smart, so now you can maybe guide them in that right direction. Okay, maybe we can partner up with a small business development center, SBDC, and then they can teach you there. Those resources are there for them for free, to educate them.
[B.151] Interviewee: So that's one of the programs. But now with the small micro-business loans, then that will focus on maybe educating the community on how to start a small business.
[B.152] Interviewee: I'm going to teach them, because it's hard, butâ€¦ so I think that's where we would be that premier mortgage company, because we know how it works. We're doing more social lending thanâ€¦
[B.153] Interviewee: what would you call the other one, dumb?
[B.154] Interviewee: off the reservation lending, you know, they're so strict, the banks, and you have to have a certain credit score. If youâ€¦ if you don't have a 750 credit score, then you're not going to get a better interest rate. And so we teach them that
[B.155] Interviewee: How important the credit score is, but at the same time, If you, Person_10 you know.
[B.156] Interviewee: justâ€¦ just in general, I think just all the different types of, like, a profit and loss, and it's just depending on what subject, but we want to be able to open up that financial literacy aspect in all the different areas of commercial lending.
[B.157] Interviewee: business lending.
[B.158] Interviewee: And mortgage lending.
[A.9] Interviewer: Absolutely. That is so important. It's really just so many of those things that people need to know, but they just don't know, and that probably factors into why there's so many
[A.10] Interviewer: Well, there's not many small businesses, you know, just.
[B.159] Interviewee: It's like.
[A.11] Interviewer: I don't know.
[A.12] Interviewer: Are you able to, Person_10 I mean, I was gonna say, are you able to speak to that, but it's not reallyâ€¦ I mean, what have you seen, like, in our communities? I mean, definitely within Isletta, but then beyond.
[B.160] Interviewee: I've seen the need for financial education.
[A.13] Interviewer: Right.
[B.161] Interviewee: And that has been probably the most important thing. Educatingâ€¦ it's nice to be able to get out there and say.
[B.162] Interviewee: we're not hereâ€¦ we're here to helpâ€¦ help you, and if you feel like you have a choice, we're a native CDFI here to help you, but if you want to go to another lendingâ€¦ if you want to do aâ€¦ go to another lender, these are the things you need to look for.
[B.163] Interviewee: How to shop for, you know, what are the closing costs involved in? What's a down payment?
[B.164] Interviewee: What are the fees? What's your interest rate? What's the APR? How much are you spending out through the whole years? Those are the things that we want to educate them. So now, when they start these classes, they come back more knowledgeable.
[B.165] Interviewee: They're not intimidated, their credit has improved. They come back.
[B.166] Interviewee: They're staying away from payday lenders.
[B.167] Interviewee: And that's our goal, and maybe instead of charging them [Financial_Amount] I mean, [Financial_Amount]â€¦ 300% in interest, or 100%, maybe the highest is 8â€¦ our interest rates go anywhere between 8% to 16% on consumer loans, but those are our riskier loans.
[B.168] Interviewee: And if you continue to borrow after the third loan, or if youâ€¦ or if you want to
[B.169] Interviewee: end up taking a financial education class and sit down with one of the Organization_14 counselors, then maybe you'll get the incentive of getting the lower interest rate at 8%. So, what have I seen? We've seenâ€¦ we've seen them budget their money more. We've seen them become successful homeowners.
[A.14] Interviewer: And, plus, at the same time, they're being educated.
[A.15] Interviewer: Absolutely, that's huge.
[B.170] Interviewee: And they're not afraid, and they're starting to teach their kids now in the homes, as young adults, they're starting to work with them.
[A.16] Interviewer: Absolutely. What you mentioned about, like, not being as intimidated by that information, you know, they're gonna walk into these spaces, to these rooms, and say, I know this information.
[B.171] Interviewee: Yeah, I've heard that before, what is that? And we're like, it's okay, don'tâ€¦ if you're notâ€¦ I mean, we'reâ€¦ we're used to this lingo all the time. Weâ€¦ we speak it every day, so even as a new, you know, as a new staff member coming in, it was nice, because we sent one of ourâ€¦ our new staff
[B.172] Interviewee: members to a training for financial literacy, and then even just having him come back and telling me, wow, I learned the difference between one-on-one counseling
[B.173] Interviewee: Financial education and financial coaching.
[B.174] Interviewee: and financial literacy, he goes, they're all different. And I said, you're right, they're all different. And then that component of becoming a homeowner, educating them on homeowner maintenance, they don't know.
[B.175] Interviewee: They can come in and they think the resâ€¦ they think the housing authority is responsible to fix everything, and you'reâ€¦ no, you need to take that responsibility. These are things that you can do as a homeowner and not be so dependent on the housing authority. So I guess that gives you your independence also.
[A.17] Interviewer: Absolutely. Wow, that's just amazing. So, as you're talking about, you know, these differentâ€¦ well, the athletic community, but also these other communities, how do you work with, like, tribal leadership? Like, how do you, Person_10
[A.18] Interviewer: How do youâ€¦ pivot.
[B.176] Interviewee: I think just, you know, staying really involved in the community.
[B.177] Interviewee: And attending as many things that we can, and focusing. One of the main reasons that we moved back over here is because, well, you know, the money, but itâ€¦ we lost that sense of community engagement.
[B.178] Interviewee: And we didn'tâ€¦ we started feelingâ€¦ I personally, and I think, you know, I can speak for Miranda, too, we kind of felt like, off the reservation, we were, like, becoming a lender.
[A.19] Interviewer: And then the board.
[B.179] Interviewee: Our board and everybody was focusing on that bigger lender.

Page 5

[B.180] Interviewee: part of it, and we were like, no, you know what? The community misses us. Theyâ€¦ we'reâ€¦ we're engaged with theâ€¦
[B.181] Interviewee: We go before Organization_22 at least a couple of years, once a year.
[B.182] Interviewee: And let them know this is what's going on, give them an update. And then on theâ€¦
[B.183] Interviewee: staying, I guess, Engaged with them, and we've even had the governors come to us for loans.
[B.184] Interviewee: Which is nice. And they, they see that we're holding the financial literacy classes here.
[B.185] Interviewee: And being here at the governor's office is good and bad. It's good because they seeâ€¦ the leadership sees exactly what we're doing for the community, so they're moreâ€¦
[B.186] Interviewee: proud, I guess, excited for us to be back.
[B.187] Interviewee: Because they see howâ€¦ the difference that we're making at the community. They're notâ€¦ our tribal members aren't having to drive into Location_9 to come and see us. Now that we're having more traffic walking in now.
[B.188] Interviewee: Than we ever did, because it's a bigger deal. You know, people don't want to drive all the way to get an application. Some of them don't have computers, some of them just like walking in and making that payment, picking up an application, and so the governors and lieutenants and the staff see that.
[B.189] Interviewee: being engaged in the Halloween Carnival.
[B.190] Interviewee: anything that we can do. And then now that we're going to other pueblos, we've been visiting, like, the northern pueblos.
[B.191] Interviewee: And we went out there marketing, and we were like, Person_10
[B.192] Interviewee: they've asked us to go in and do, like, shops, like, oh, I guess maybe some financial literacy classes there, you know, we've done that, and just kind of helping the other commu- the other Native communities.
[A.20] Interviewer: Absolutely. That isâ€¦ thank you. Thank you for sharing that, because that's really important information that I think people just are intimidated by, and they just don't learn more about what's needed there.
[B.193] Interviewee: Yeah, and we're also known on a national level, so I got the opportunity to go into Location_11 and speak before Organization_8, and weâ€¦ I went up there with the governor, and I think just Tiwa is kind of, like, known on that national level with the leadership.
[B.194] Interviewee: and going out there and networking. And then the grants that we've received from Organization_1, itâ€¦ we'reâ€¦
[B.195] Interviewee: You know, it just shows that we've been successful. And that's all just being out there.
[B.196] Interviewee: And engaging with the community. Out of sight, out of mind, you know, right? You're not there, then they, you know, like, oh, I think I remember you, or I remember, why did you guys move? And then some of them will even say.
[B.197] Interviewee: Well, we haven't heard anything about Tiwa, so being in the, you know, creating a Facebook page, putting letters in the newsletter, just that social media presence is what we're working on, too.
[B.198] Interviewee: Person_11.
[A.21] Interviewer: That's great. Actually, I was gonna ask you about social media, like, how do youâ€¦ do you feel like you, Person_10 like, you have a greater presence by utilizing social media, or likeâ€¦.
[B.199] Interviewee: We're trying. That was probably one of our weakâ€¦ one of our weaknesses was social media, and we have a Facebook page. We're having a hard time creating an Instagram, so I don't knowâ€¦ we're having a hard time with that. But, you know, being in the newsletter, Facebook.
[B.200] Interviewee: you know, posting more, you know, another home closed by Organization_5, or the financial education classes, orâ€¦ you know, I think we'reâ€¦ so our two weaknesses that we're really working on is our storytelling.
[B.201] Interviewee: We know how many people we've helped. And I think sometimes we get so caught up in the day-to-day activities.
[B.202] Interviewee: That we forget about theâ€¦ so when we have somebody come in, and they close on a home, and then they start crying, and then you look at them, and you're like, and then we start crying, because their journey through obtaining a home wasâ€¦
[B.203] Interviewee: They did it. They completed the 11 weeks classes, they got their credit, they worked on their credit, they became that homeowner, they're having a home for their family.
[B.204] Interviewee: And instead of us saying, yes, we helped, we closed another loan, we need to say how many families did we help, the impact. And I thinkâ€¦ well, I know, kind of, that that's probably where we're very weak in, and we're working on that, because we have helped a lot of families get into homes, but we just don't tell our stories.
[B.205] Interviewee: Very well.
[B.206] Interviewee: Absolutely. And they need to be compelling. And most of our investors and everybody that we talk to, it's all about
[B.207] Interviewee: the help, and how you help them. They don't care about the numbers. I mean, they do, yes, but it's more about
[B.208] Interviewee: how did you help this family get into the home? You helped another family get in, or they started a small business with the help of you.
[B.209] Interviewee: Person_11.
[A.22] Interviewer: Absolutely, that's huge, and just thatâ€¦ because it is an emotional process of, you know, learning about different things, and then doing it yourself, or, you know, working with people to make it happen.
[A.23] Interviewer: It'sâ€¦ it's just amazing.
[A.24] Interviewer: Because when you get those keys, and you're like, okay, I did this, you know, like, you know, of course you got help along the way, but then you're like, okay, I'm responsible for these things, and this and that.
[A.25] Interviewer: Yeah, just thinking about, like, when I got those keys to my house, and I'm thinking, like, wow, this is, likeâ€¦ and it's not my dream house, you know, because there were so many people that were coming in from, like, other states, you know, with, like, cash, and I'm thinking, like, I'm not able to compete with that.
[B.210] Interviewee: Right? Right. Yeah. And they were overbidding on those homes. I think, you know, so, like, if the appraised value was, I'll just say, [Financial_Amount]
[B.211] Interviewee: Well, we'll say [Financial_Amount] now. But, you know, [Financial_Amount] and then that's what it appraises for? Well, who wants to buy a home if it doesn't appraise for them? And they were offering [Financial_Amount].
[B.212] Interviewee: And you know how you don't compete with those type of investors? And I think that's with the rates being so low, and I think that's kind of where we were trying to be moreâ€¦ making it Organization_14 more affordable, because then with COVID hitting, in [Year] when COVID hit, Person_7
[B.213] Interviewee: It justâ€¦ everything changed.
[A.26] Interviewer: Right then.
[B.214] Interviewee: Our financial education classes were on Location_3.
[B.215] Interviewee: And, yeah, so we were doing that, we tried doing that, and then just getting people comfortable to go out there and be in public again. That was hard. Soâ€¦ but we were still doing closings, we were still doing everything, and even though it was on Location_3, we did it.
[A.27] Interviewer: Absolutely. Are you able to expand upon that, upon what you, like, how you made those different classes happen on Location_3 and doing, like, that entire change?
[B.216] Interviewee: Yeah, Miranda, collaborated withâ€¦ do you know Vicki? You're from Location_4?
[A.28] Interviewer: So, Person_8, have youâ€¦ do you know Person_8, John?
[B.217] Interviewee: Oh man, John? Okay, so we just started working with her. We partnered up, and she works with the state, she has a financial literacy class through there. So then weâ€¦ soâ€¦ so going off of that.
[B.218] Interviewee: we started doing home ownership meet and greets. So then, not only did we start doingâ€¦ talking about counseling, like budgeting and savings, then we took it a step further, and we said, let's start educating the community on obtaining a home.
[A.29] Interviewer: And soâ€¦.
[B.219] Interviewee: Weâ€¦ the preâ€¦ like, the application process, the closing costs, the down payment, the different types of products that are out there, to let themâ€¦ to let them know

Page 6

[B.220] Interviewee: that you can get a VA, you can get an FHA, you can get conventional, or you can go with a native CDFI. This is what you're going to experience on and off the reservation, and soâ€¦
[B.221] Interviewee: you know, so that's another development services that we focused on, is the home ownership component. And the process, because it's intimidating there, too, and what to expect.
[A.30] Interviewer: Right. It's true, because when you're faced with, like, different terms, like the gap,
[A.31] Interviewer: I don't want to say the gap addendum, but I know just learning about, like, that gap insurance and things of, like, what that would mean in terms of, like, okay, it's appraising for, like, this particular amount, but I mean, you're like, oh boy.
[A.32] Interviewer: Like, what does that mean, right? You're, like, learning about all these different terms, and you're like, man, this is going beyond lingo, this is, like, you knowâ€¦.
[B.222] Interviewee: Andâ€¦ and then another thing that we did, too, that is insurances. Like, the different types of insurances. Like, what's a dwelling? What's personal property? What's personal liability? Whatâ€¦ do you want flood insurance? Do you need a home? There's, like, soâ€¦ and that's all I canâ€¦ even for me, I'm like.
[B.223] Interviewee: you know, like, I know I need this insurance, I know I need this, what's the least expensive one that's gonna still give me my coverages, and shopping, and educating them?
[B.224] Interviewee: That even though we pick insurance, that we have to keep an eye on it, because it changes dramatically in a year. It can go up, and it's happened to me twice.
[A.33] Interviewer: Yay.
[B.225] Interviewee: And do I want personal life? Do I need that gap insurance? Like, if I get in a car wreck and I borrow money, you know, and those are things that we also educate in our classes on the different types of homeowners insurance and the different types of insurances that are out there.
[A.34] Interviewer: Absolutely. It'sâ€¦
[A.35] Interviewer: The entire learning process is just, you know, thinking about, you know, the fact of, like, what you're doing and helping people learn, but also combining what they already know, like, the culture component of, you know, like, it's notâ€¦
[A.36] Interviewer: all just Western information. There's, like, non-Western and Indigenous information as well. Like, that, Person_10
[A.37] Interviewer: some people haven't seen that before, andâ€¦ I mean, is there, like, another way that you would term that, or is thatâ€¦
[A.38] Interviewer: What you, what you feel like your, your, your company does?
Person_2 that again, I'm sorry.
[A.39] Interviewer: So when people are, like, learning about these things, they're like, oh, that's just Western information, so theyâ€¦ some people want to learn more about it, but then others don't. They just, Person_10 they're like, oh, that's not for me, you know, should Iâ€¦.
[B.226] Interviewee: Should I look?
[A.40] Interviewer: And it sounds like yourâ€¦ your organization does that, like, your company does that. Like, they are able to, like, take this information and combine it with what they already know, like, their Indigenous knowledge.
[B.227] Interviewee: Yeah.
[A.41] Interviewer: A unit?
[B.228] Interviewee: And thenâ€¦ and I think with the budgeting, when you were saying Indigenous, you know, everything is based, like, how important your budget is, because you have a lot ofâ€¦ with the feasts coming up.
[B.229] Interviewee: Do youâ€¦ do you ever put money aside for the feast?
[B.230] Interviewee: Or are you gonnaâ€¦ Gina, are you gonnaâ€¦
[B.231] Interviewee: Do your fee stuff and then not pay your mortgage payment.
[B.232] Interviewee: your house payment. And so then, what can you do? So when fees comes around, what can you do to make sure you have that money? Because in your four walls, like, what's important if your life happens?
Person_2 happen, having an emergency fund.
[B.233] Interviewee: having an emergâ€¦ you know, 6 months of emergency in case you get laid off. You can be working withâ€¦ you can be working with a company for years, and not have a retirement, and not have a savings, but be withâ€¦
[B.234] Interviewee: And have good credit scores, and then what happens if you get laid off?
[B.235] Interviewee: what are youâ€¦ what are you gonna do? You know? And Iâ€¦ and Iâ€¦ and I think right now isâ€¦ we need to start focusing that, because I have a feeling that that's gonnaâ€¦
[B.236] Interviewee: With everything going on now in the economy.
[B.237] Interviewee: I feel like we need to kind of start going back to the basics and focusing more on that budgeting and how important your savings is.
[B.238] Interviewee: Right. Because you could be at your job a long time, and then you getâ€¦
[B.239] Interviewee: let go, because there's no federal grant money, or you don't have no retirement, then how are you going to pay that house that you've been living in for all these years? And then where are you going to go live, and then notâ€¦ and then pay an apartment for more than your house payment?
[A.42] Interviewer: Sure.
[B.240] Interviewee: Andâ€¦ and Iâ€¦ and we just had that discussion yesterday. I think we need to bring that back in, a little focus more on that inâ€¦ when we'reâ€¦ when we're meeting with it, with our tribal members.
[A.43] Interviewer: Absolutely, that isâ€¦ that is a great example of, you know, thinking about
[A.44] Interviewer: do I allocate this money for, like, feast expenses, or, like, pay my mortgage? And, like, that.
[B.241] Interviewee: Yes.
[A.45] Interviewer: real conversation that I was having with different people, like, last week, over the past couple weeks, and just thinking about, like, well, this is important, and so people are not, you know, before owning a house, they're not really thinking about, like, the large.
[B.242] Interviewee: Person_11.
[A.46] Interviewer: Of, say, like, not paying a mortgage.
[B.243] Interviewee: Yeah, and then you teach them, like, your four walls, like, if, you know, something happens, and then you'reâ€¦ you're stuck, and you're like, oh, what do I need to pay? Do I pay my credit card? Well, you have your four walls. You need yourâ€¦ your house payment, you need your utilities, how are you going to get to work?
[B.244] Interviewee: So you need a car. And, you know, so you kind of learn your priorities. But look at me, I've been doing this for so many years.
[B.245] Interviewee: Andâ€¦ and I'm a perfect example ofâ€¦ I didn't start my retirement until late. I could be at this job for, you know, I've been here for 16 years, ifâ€¦ and I still have a house payment. I'm in that same boat as everybody else.
[B.246] Interviewee: Whereâ€¦ if I don't start working on my savings.
[B.247] Interviewee: then I lose my job, how am I gonna do my house payment? Where am I gonna go live?
[B.248] Interviewee: And I think with that perspective.
[B.249] Interviewee: then you're like, no, I need to think about that, because it's happening now, right in front of our eyes. Look how many governmentâ€¦ look how many, just on TV, how many people that have lost their jobs. Their jobs have been, you know, taken away.
[A.47] Interviewer: Absolutely.

Page 7

[B.250] Interviewee: And it can happen with me, too, maybe with the effect of what's going on. You know, are weâ€¦ how are we going to handle our organization?
[B.251] Interviewee: We can'tâ€¦ we don't want to overstaff. We don't want to be understaffed.
[B.252] Interviewee: But we still want to help, andâ€¦ and I thinkâ€¦ I keep saying, I think I need to stop saying. But, you know, asâ€¦ as we get older and wiser, then we'll just start learning. You still have to instill how important a savings is, I guess.
[A.48] Interviewer: Absolutely. Very much so.
[A.49] Interviewer: Wow, this is really important information. And so, it's like, you spoke, you know, a little bit about, how much you did during COVID. Do you feel like that's changed where things are going for the future?
[B.253] Interviewee: For COVID, we actually had a very good year for COVID. You would think that we would have shut down, but we were able to work from home for a few years, and when we left the reservation, we worked from home, and then we
[B.254] Interviewee: We got another office. â€¦
[B.255] Interviewee: Weâ€¦ we hadâ€¦ one of our barriers was that the minute we moved off the reservation, we had to be licensed through the state.
[B.256] Interviewee: And we had to stop all business, allâ€¦ everything halted. And so we couldn't do any mortgages, we had to get licensed, we had to pass a test.
[B.257] Interviewee: That took 23 hours worth of studying, and we had to pass it with 75 minimal, and just to make sure that we were in compliance, they talked a lot about redlining being the equal credit opportunity, no discrimination, and
[B.258] Interviewee: all these laws that I wasn't even aware of, like redlining. I so really couldn'tâ€¦ I mean, there's justâ€¦ but that's howâ€¦
[B.259] Interviewee: That's howâ€¦
[B.260] Interviewee: intense, those otherâ€¦ but once youâ€¦ once you pass the test, and then you continue to stay in compliance, then you're like, okay, we're okay, we don't want to loseâ€¦
[B.261] Interviewee: our license. So, making sure that our staff, making sure that my staff is licensed, so they can go out there and negotiate interest rates and talk to the consumers, more about negotiating, you know, the rates and educating them.
[B.262] Interviewee: So, after COVID, I think it just got easier. I think probably in [Year],
[B.263] Interviewee: 3 is when we got our license, maybe? But then we had a lot of other barriers, because then they put, Person_10
[B.264] Interviewee: Isletta became a hearth act.
[B.265] Interviewee: they, they joined the Hearth Act, and they never had anybody, a realistâ€¦ they never had a royalty specialist in place.
[B.266] Interviewee: So they signed off, and BIA completely said, you're on your own, so we didn't have those resources anymore through BIA. So now we're still back to where we're at, and it'sâ€¦ how many years later? And we've been part of the Earth Act for a few years, and we're stillâ€¦ we don'tâ€¦ we're stuck.
[B.267] Interviewee: And so we couldn'tâ€¦ they haltedâ€¦ BIA halted all the lending for the residential leases for Sleta.
[B.268] Interviewee: And so that was another barrier. We were in a flood zone area. Theyâ€¦
[B.269] Interviewee: They signed, with the FEMA. They put us in a flood zone area, so all of this leda became in a flood zone area. So now to get flood insurance is more expensive.
[B.270] Interviewee: to push that onto the homeowner. So how do we mitigate our risk? We ended up having them build up. So all that happened, like, during COVID. After COVID,
[B.271] Interviewee: We're kind of like, okay, we got our license, we're lending off the reservation, things are going good, but guess what? No.
[B.272] Interviewee: the government is gonna maybe get rid of CDFIs.
[B.273] Interviewee: You know, so it's like, are we going to be affected? And we're not going to be affected. We just maybe won't be a certified community development financial institution, which is known as a CDFI.
[B.274] Interviewee: We might not beâ€¦ we're going to, Person_10 we're going toâ€¦ right now, we're in the process of getting recertified, but it's really tough, I heard.
[B.275] Interviewee: But if for some reason that doesn't go through, we're still going to be okay, because as long as we're licensed through the state, we continue to look for capital other places instead of going to the government.
[B.276] Interviewee: And kind of continue toâ€¦ maybe seller loans, like we were telling you, on the secondary market.
[B.277] Interviewee: go to other investors, but the whole goal is to continue to keep the money in the Native communities.
[B.278] Interviewee: And then we can help them.
[B.279] Interviewee: So, yes, it's been great for us after COVID, and then now we're still gonna have this, but what are we gonna do? And then now, I think another thing that we're thinking of is.
[B.280] Interviewee: after COVID, because everything went off, like, the tariffs, is things gonnaâ€¦ or is building a home or purchasing a home gonna be more expensive?
[B.281] Interviewee: And how do weâ€¦ still stay that.
[B.282] Interviewee: native CDFI that's gonna be able to still have our homes affordable.
[B.283] Interviewee: And still maintain our staff.
[B.284] Interviewee: You know, there's a lot of things you have to think about when you're running a business, and we don'tâ€¦ we got help from the tribe when we first started, but we've done everything on our own since then.
[A.50] Interviewer: Wow.
[A.51] Interviewer: Absolutely, it meansâ€¦.
[B.285] Interviewee: We are a separate entity, I don't know if you knew that.
[A.52] Interviewer: Oh, no, I wasâ€¦ I was gonna ask about that.
[B.286] Interviewee: Yeah, so we're a separate entity, but we were created through the joint efforts of Organization_11 and, and Organization_16. So through them, then we were able to take that [Financial_Amount].5 million
[B.287] Interviewee: loan portfolio, and grow it to, you know, [Financial_Amount].5 million. They gave us some seed money, and then from there, that 10% went to operations, and then 90% went to
[B.288] Interviewee: home ownership, and from there, that's been our bread and butter, and so we've been re-lending off of that. We've been earning the interest, putting money aside for principal. At the time when we were able to apply for grants.
[B.289] Interviewee: Then we would get technical assistance, and so as this money kept
[B.290] Interviewee: coming in, weâ€¦ it helps survive for operations, so just putting money aside for operations, and Iâ€¦ and I guess that's where it comes, like, being a business owner, you know, as a non-profit. How are we going to be sustainable?
[A.53] Interviewer: Absolutely. Wow, that's really important information, and just, Person_10, there's just so much. Is itâ€¦ oh, do you overwhelm me? Did I give you too much? No, no, this is perfect, because, you know, it's justâ€¦ there's so many things that, like, people don't know. They don't know about, like, how thingsâ€¦
[A.54] Interviewer: are, you know, how people are working with different, you know, parts of information, and just, like, how much you'veâ€¦ you've, like, adapted, but you're also making things work, you know, withâ€¦ with your business, and for the community, and it's justâ€¦ it's just wonderful to see that.
[B.291] Interviewee: Yeah, and it's strictly for Native Americans.
[A.55] Interviewer: Person_11 That'sâ€¦ that's important, too.

Page 8

[A.56] Interviewer: Do people need to show, like, certain identification? Like, do they show their CIB, or, like, their, Person_10.
[B.292] Interviewee: Yeah, that's one of our requirements, yeah.
[A.57] Interviewer: Okay, wonderful.
[A.58] Interviewer: Was there anything that we didn't talk about? Because I feel like I learned so much, you know.
[B.293] Interviewee: I feel like I gave you too much, I don't know whatâ€¦ Exactly.
[A.59] Interviewer: Great! I mean, all theâ€¦ as you were talking, you know, I'm thinking, like, all these questions that I have, you know, you're answering them as we're going along, and so it's just sort of likeâ€¦.
[B.294] Interviewee: You know, how you're doing whatâ€¦ what you're doing is essentially what we'reâ€¦ what we'reâ€¦.
[A.60] Interviewer: And so, when the, Person_10 I'm thinking I want, you know, my daughter's school at Location_2 High toâ€¦ to learn more about.
[B.295] Interviewee: Yes!
[A.61] Interviewer: But what you're doingâ€¦.
[B.296] Interviewee: We have, a lead, what do you call, a liaison at Location_2? Soâ€¦.
[A.62] Interviewer: Probably?
[B.297] Interviewee: Okay, we're gonna open it up, or our Organization_7 gonna be in March.
[B.298] Interviewee: And if you have any CIPI students that would love to attend, we'll let you know. And, we have that scheduled in March. We're putting it together, we're just putting the date, I think we got the date. And then also, we'll go ahead and we send it out to all the schools, APS.
[B.299] Interviewee: So maybe your daughter, if maybe we can get the liaison's,
[B.300] Interviewee: name, if you have, and you can getâ€¦ email it to me, then we'll make sure that we reach out, because it's kind of hard, because I know Miranda tries to go out through, like, the whole APS area.
[A.63] Interviewer: It can be challenging, for sure, you're right.
[B.301] Interviewee: But the wholeâ€¦
[B.302] Interviewee: At the end of the day, I mean, the most important thing is getting him to come to this one-day event, and learning about all of this stuff.
[B.303] Interviewee: And who knows, maybe it's a career path your daughter might want to take.
[A.64] Interviewer: Absolutely, that'd beâ€¦ it's so important to have this information and to go.
[A.65] Interviewer: Right, that'sâ€¦.
[B.304] Interviewee: Yeah. And how do I become a loan officer? If this is what I want to pursue in my career, what are the steps that I need to take to get this done? Andâ€¦ and thenâ€¦
[B.305] Interviewee: And it is pretty easy, but it's just testing and how fast you can retain it, and are you good at taking the test? But for the most part, once you do it, then you just keep up with the continuing education. But there's money to be made, also.
[B.306] Interviewee: You know, here we're a non-profit, so we don'tâ€¦ we're not, Person_10 We're not sure, Person_10
[B.307] Interviewee: like, as far as, we're not on commission, we don't work on commission, it's salary, so our whole goal is we're different than other lenders, because they'reâ€¦ work on commission, probably, and they have to meet a certain quota. You know, weâ€¦
[B.308] Interviewee: We know that we have to run a business, we know where we kind of need to be to continue to grow, but we're not.
[B.309] Interviewee: Based onâ€¦ everything is more non-profit, helping the community, and that's why we were created.
Person_1, wow.
[B.310] Interviewee: Summer.
[A.66] Interviewer: That's huge. That's.
[B.311] Interviewee: Dawaii, Person_2, thank you for taking thisâ€¦ Thank you.
[A.67] Interviewer: to talk with me, and, you know, and I'm so excited for, the students and, like, the other people as part of this project to learn.
[B.312] Interviewee: Like, everything that your company's doing with Organization_4, and so it's justâ€¦ it's really exciting.
[B.313] Interviewee: Yeah, and if you'd ever like to talk to the staff, let me know. They're very passionate, soâ€¦
[B.314] Interviewee: You, you know, you mightâ€¦ there might be some more insights, or, you know, the day-to-day in talking with home ownershipâ€¦ their home ownership counselors, and that they work more hands-on withâ€¦ with the borrowers, butâ€¦.
[A.68] Interviewer: For the most part, you know, we're very team-oriented, and we workâ€¦.
[B.315] Interviewee: Together, and that'sâ€¦ at the end of the day, how many people are we helping?
[B.316] Interviewee: Absolutely. â€¦is what's more important to us.
[B.317] Interviewee: Person_11.
[A.69] Interviewer: Absolutely.
[A.70] Interviewer: Well, Person_12, thank you.
